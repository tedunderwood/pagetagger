RANCE and Prussia had signed the Treaty of
Geneva in 1864. During the two years that fol-
lowed, this treaty, for the amelioration of the
condition of wounded soldiers, had been accepted
by nearly all the Governments of Europe, and
national relief societies had been organized in each State in
accordance with its terms.
The Austro-Prussian War of 1866 afforded to several of these
societies the first opportunity for active work. The character
and value of the services rendered to sick arid wounded soldiers
by voluntary associations during that war, I have myself en-
deavoured to show in a work entitled "Sanitary Institutions
during the Austro-Prussian Conflict." The experience gained
during the war of 1866 was moreover of great service to the
voluntary societies. The field within which their action might
be beneficial was more clearly marked out, and their position as
institutions of public utility definitively established. In certain
States the organization of the societies was modified and im-
proved—in all it was invigorated and strengthened.
The great war of 1870-71 was a fearful contest between the
two wealthy and powerful nations which had first given in their
adhesion to the Treaty of Geneva, and in which the principle of
creating popular aid for the wounded in war had been most
<pb>
generally accepted, and the organization of the relief societies
was most complete. The circumstances under which the action
of these societies was then tested were not only rich in opportu-
nities of usefulness, but seemed to offer the most favourable con-
ditions for the practice of voluntary relief in behalf of the victims
of battle-fields. During the war the popular sympathy for the
wounded was intense, and the liveliest interest was taken in the
movements and operations of the French and German societies.
Since the close of the war the friends of charity and beneficence
in every quarter of the world have been anxious to learn, to the
fullest extent, the character of their services and the practical
results of their labours.
Conscious, therefore, of the desirableness as well as the utility
of assembling the facts concerning the action of the volunteer
relief societies during this war, so classified that they might be
easily compared, and so presented that they might clearly teach
the lessons to be derived from them, 1 proposed before the close
of the war to prepare a full and complete history of the labours
of these societies. Such a work, however, could not be written
until data covering a very wide field of operations had been col-
lected, nor before the reports of the principal associations had
been made public. The difficulties in the way of obtaining from
official sources the necessary information have made it im-
possible for me to finish this work within the time originally
proposed.
While, however, the relief societies founded upon the Treaty
of Geneva were national in their organization, as also in their
more immediate and specific purposes, they were the representa-
tives of a common cause, and were closely affiliated in action as
well as in sympathy.
The Franco-German War of 1870-71, in opening out a vast and
comparatively new field for organized patriotic benevolence, offered
also the first great occasion for the exercise of international sym-
pathy and assistance. The occasion was not unheeded. If
armies were never before more abundantly supplied by national
voluntary effort—never before in human history have belligerents
received from foreign and neutral States such generous aid. The
action of the French and German societies for battle-field relief,
<pb>
xi
was largely sustained by foreign contributions, and the suffer-
ings incident to the war assuaged by the liberalities of aliens.
Foreign charities, however, were generally distributed through
local organizations, and lost their national character in the pro-
cess of distribution.
The American International Sanitary Committee of Paris was
formed almost immediately after the declaration of war in 1870,
for the purpose of being a direct agent of American charity in
behalf of the victims of the war. It was, moreover, the only
foreign association created for the general succour of the wounded
that succeeded in preserving throughout the war, on belligerent
territory, a complete independence in the direction of its opera-
tions and in the immediate distribution of its assistance. The
committee began its labours by organizing an ambulance, or field
hospital, at Paris.
Few organizations for the relief of the wounded during the
late war, acquired a more noble celebrity than the American
ambulance. As an expression of international goodwill, it at
the time secured for itself the gratitude of the French people.
As an expression of earnest personal effort, of the courage and
generous devotion of compatriots, it cannot soon be forgotten
by Americans. As an expression of modern sanitary science,
however, it has been chiefly valued, and probably will be longest
remembered, by all.1 Its mission was significant—its work was
one of usefulness. To commemorate, therefore, the services of
those who laboured in the American ambulance, or contributed
to its success, and to preserve a record of its acts and methods,
are duties equally imposed.
This volume contains the history of that ambulance.
It was my original intention to publish it together with, and
as a part of, my general history of voluntary effort in behalf of the
1 Says a French medical authority, in speaking of the American ambulance:—
"Nous accordons a cet ^tablissement une importance tout-a-fait capitale, moins pour
les services qu'il a rendus, et qui sont du reste considerables, que pour les ve'rit^s
importantes qu'il nous a fait toucher du doigt. Desormais la mobilisation des
hopitaux temporaires est un probUme risolu." (" Nouveau Dictionnaire de Medecine
et de Chirurgie Pratiques." J.-B. Bailliere, Paris, 1873; art, Hopital, tome xvii.
p. 726.)
<pb>
sick and wounded during the late war. The causes mentioned
have held in abeyance the publication of that work. But as
most of the material which appears in this volume has been a
long time ready for the press, it has not seemed to me expedient
to retain it any longer. I accordingly now issue the "History
of the American Ambulance," complete, in a single volume,
which will form also the first volume of my general history of
"Sanitary Associations during the Franco-German War of 1870-
1871."
I have endeavoured to present in it a clear statement of the
purposes of the American International Sanitary Committee, of
the difficulties they encountered, of the labours they accomplished,
and of the successes which finally crowned their undertaking.
The admirable reports of the gentlemen who were especially
entrusted with the administrative and executive work of the
Committee—treating upon those subjects which are more par-
ticularly scientific and technical—complete the history of the
ambulance.
The report prepared by Dr. Edward A. Crane is an exhaustive
essay in which the writer has not only stated the essential facts
connected with the material organization of the American ambu-
lance, but has discussed at length the principles in accordance
with which army hospitals have been, and should be, established,
and the general character and qualities of temporary and portable
shelter.
The surgical and medical histories of the ambulance will be
read, I believe, with great interest by that portion of the public,
to which they are now more particularly addressed. Dr. Swin-
burne's cases are fully and concisely stated, as are also the pecu-
liar difficulties under which he contended while treating them.
Dr. Johnson's report, if brief, is nevertheless instructive.
In presenting this volume to the world I shall solicit a gene-
rous criticism not only in my own behalf, but in behalf of those
who have laboured with me in its preparation. Verbal errors,
and mistakes even in fact, may doubtless be found. These, as
every one knows, are more or less unavoidable, especially in a
work, parts of which have been edited for absent writers, and all
of which has been hurried through the press in the midst of
<pb>
xiii
numerous personal pre-occupations. I believe, however, that while
the special subject of the volume may commend it to the favour
of many, the facts it presents in connection with the general his-
tory of army hospitals will render it a valuable contribution to
the medico-military literature of the day.

COMMITTEE OF PARIS.
<pb>
■
HEN, on the 15th of July, 1870, war had been
virtually declared against Prussia by the state-
ment made in the French Legislative Cbamber,
by the Duke de Grammont, I was strongly im-
pressed with the importance of giving, in the
struggle thus suddenly precipitated between the two great
military powers of Europe, a practical demonstration of the value
of the improved methods of treating the wounded, whose re-
sults, as illustrated by the experience of the "United States
Sanitary Commission" and the American Government, I had been
endeavouring for many years to bring to the knowledge of the
friends of sanitary reform throughout the world. I therefore
determined to call a meeting of American citizens, resident or
sojourning in Paris, for the purpose of devising such measures
as should best enable the friends of the cause to work together
to that end, and thus render effectual and practical assistance
to the French and German Ambulance Service, in the event of a
Franco-Prussian war.
After I had conferred with the leading members of the
American colony in Paris, a call for a meeting was immediately
issued; and the meeting, attended by twenty or twenty-five
gentlemen, was held in my rooms, 15, Rue de la Paix, on the
18th of July. I was requested to take the chair, and Dr. Crane
was called upon to act as secretary. The chairman opened the
<pb>
meeting with a brief address, in which he alluded to the imminence
of war, and the painful results which must necessarily follow
the breaking out of a military conflict between two such nations
as those that were preparing to take the field; he referred to the
eminent services rendered by the Sanitary Commission during
the Civil War in America, and pointed out the importance of initi-
ating some definite plan of action to the same end, in view of the
approaching struggle, not merely as a means of providing addi-
tional succour for the wounded, but as the means which might
seem most likely to shed light upon the more important pro-
blems connected with volunteer relief in war, and which might
at the same time give a new impulse to popular charity, by
setting a fresh example of international sympathy and assistance;
and he defined the object of the meeting to be the consideration
of the means to be employed for organizing this assistance, and
rendering it beneficial.
The chairman called the attention of the meeting to the
desirability of organizing a collective action of the Americans in
Paris, in view of the approaching conflict, which seemed about to
offer an excellent opportunity of showing the practical operation
of the American system in providing for the transport, shelter,
nourishment, and medical and hygienic treatment of the wounded.
And he particularly insisted on this consideration, viz., that one
of the chief objects with Americans, under the circumstances of
the case, should be to make known to European sanitarians by
practical examples, those systems of hospital construction, trans-
portation, and appliances for the care of the wounded, which had
received the sanction of American experience as most suitable in
war; observing, that such an addition to the sanitary knowledge
of Europe would be far more valuable and useful than any mere
giving of material aid to either French or German ambulances, even
though it were possible to collect millions of francs for that pur-
pose; and that, therefore, a special aim of the proposed action on
the part of the Americans in Paris should be the organizing
of one or more model Field Hospitals, with their accessories, on
the plans which had been found so satisfactory during the
American war, for the purpose of demonstrating the superiority
of the methods, adjuncts, appliances, and arrangements that had
<pb>
been suggested by the experiences of that great struggle, over
those which were still employed in the official ambulances of
Europe. And, finally, he urged the meeting to take immediate
action, in view of the impending events, by forming a Committee
which might begin the work, which he had every reason to
believe the " American International Association for the Relief of
the Misery of Battle-fields," would ultimately conduct in the
name of the whole American people. "It was," he said, " our
duty and our privilege, here on the ground, to make, in behalf
of our fellow citizens, the first response to any call for assistance
in aid of the wounded."
Mr. Tucker then made a few remarks, expressing approval of
the views that had been brought forward, and concluded by
offering the following resolution:—
"Resolved, that under the existing circumstances, it is deemed
expedient by this meeting to appoint a Committee of five persons,
including the chairman and secretary, with power to add to their
number, to act in connection with the 'American Association for
the Relief of the Misery of Battle-fields,' the 'Societe Inter-
nationale,' the 'Societe de Secours aux Blesses,' and other
kindred societies, for the purpose of relieving the wants and
sufferings of soldiers during the war which is now anticipated
between France and Prussia."
This resolution having been unanimously adopted, Drs. Evans,
Crane and Pratt, Col. James McKaye, and Mr. A. L. Ward,
were elected to constitute this Committee—Dr. Evans being
named President, and Dr. Crane Secretary of the same. The
meeting then separated.
The first step taken by the Committee was to issue the
following Appeal:—
"Help fob the Wounded of all Armies! An Appeal to
Citizens of the United States, Resident or Sojourn-
ing in Paris.
"The Committee appointed at a meeting of citizens of the
United States, held on the 18th inst., at the rooms of Dr.
Thomas W. Evans, to act in co-operation with the 'American
Association for the Relief of the Misery of Battle-fields,' in pro-
<pb>
curing help and care for the wounded of all armies in the impend-
ing war, deem it their duty to appeal to their fellow citizens for
pecuniary aid.
"In the great war recently waged on the other side of the
ocean, the appeal of the ' United States Sanitary Commission ' to
the humane men and women of Europe, for help for our
wounded, met with a hearty and generous response,
"In their name, and in the name of a common humanity, we
ask you to contribute, to a like great charity, such amounts as
you may feel yourself willing to give, in money or in kind.
(Signed).
Thomas W. Evans, M.D., President.
Edward A. Crane, M.D., Secretary.
Col. James McKaye.
Albert Lee Ward.
Thomas Pratt, M.D.
Paris, July 19th, 1870."
It having been decided at the first meeting of the Committee
to establish, as a practical expression of its contemplated action,
a field hospital for forty or fifty patients, combining and exem-
plifying all the improvements which it desired to bring to the
attention of the heads of the sanitary service of the French
army, the Secretary wrote, on the 19th of July, to the President
of the "American Association, for the Relief of the Misery of
Battle-fields," setting forth the motives which had determined
the formation of the Committee, and the objects it proposed to
effect, enclosing a copy of its "Appeal," and expressing the
hope that, for the furtherance of the ends it had in view, the
Association would give its co-operation to the Paris Committee.
The text of this letter was as follows:—
"15, Rue de la Paix, Pane,
"July 19, 1870.
"Henry W. Bellows, New York.
"My dear Doctor,
"Long before having received this letter you will have
learned that, living in what seemed at least a state of peace fairly
<pb>
awell secured, we have been startled by a sudden declaration of
war.
"It is not necessary to consider the causes, either remote or
immediate, which have brought this great calamity upon Europe.
Whatever they may have been, we are now stupified by the
- consequences.
"As in America, when the rebellion began, so here, we have
our hopeful ninety-days' prophets; but there is an opinion, and I
am inclined to entertain it myself, that the war will assume a
character much more serious than such a limitation might imply.
Aside from the numerous complications which may arise, this
war once begun can never be terminated until the military
ascendancy of one of the two states—France and Prussia—shall
have been definitively established. This can be effected by no
single victory, however decisive. I believe the war will be a
long one—it can hardly fail to be a most serious and disastrous
one.
"If coming events should justify this opinion, our different
'Societes de Secours ' will have a wide field open to them for the
exercise of that charity, for the proper direction of which they
have been organized. 'La Societe Francaise' held a meeting a
few days since, and under the special'patronage of the Empress,
has commenced its preparatory work. An appeal has been
issued to the people for contributions in money and in kind, and
a warm response has already been made. The German societies,
having had the experience of the war of 1866, are undoubtedly
ready to meet, generously and efficiently, any demands which may
be made upon them.
"But you will remember that our 'Soci&es de Secours ' are
leagued together—that they have been so organized that, in the
event of a war, they may co-operate for the better accomplishment
of a common good.
"Dr. Evans, as the chief American representative of sanitary
work, in Europe, has felt that some immediate action on his part
was necessary for the purpose of making known, not only his own
interest in the welfare of the wounded of the contending powers,
but the willingness of the American Association to contribute its
share in the great work before us. Accordingly, a meeting was
<pb>
held yesterday at his office, for the purpose of organizing an' Ame-
rican International Sanitary Committee.' At this meeting—at-
tended by some of the most influential American residents of Paris
—a Committee of five persons was appointed, viz.: Dr. Thomas
W. Evans, Dr. Edward A. Crane, Col. James McKaye, Albert
Lee Ward, Dr. Thomas Pratt. Dr. Evans was appointed Presi-
dent, and myself Secretary. This Committee was authorized by a
resolution to act in connection with the ' Sanitary Association of
the United States,' the ' Societe Internationale,' the 'Societe de
Secours aux Blesses,' and other kindred associations, and was
also empowered to raise money by subscription or adopt such
other measures as might seem necessary to best effect the object
for which it was created.
"You will observe that we propose to call ourselves a Com-
mittee, as also in accordance with the terms of the resolution
referred to, that we propose to act in connection with the 'Ameri-
can Association.' I write to you, the President of that asso-
ciation, to-day, for the purpose of securing, first, your co-
operation.
"Dr. Evans and myself, as members of the Executive Com-
mittee of the American Association, are confident that our action
in the present emergency—when time is all important—will
receive the fullest approbation of our colleagues. Indeed, we
cannot feel that the American Association will hesitate to regard
our Committee as, at least for the time being, its representative.
"You will naturally watch with interest and sympathy all
movements in behalf of the sick and wounded during the coming
contest. That you should offer some visible and permanent evi-
dence of such interest and sympathy to the European societies
with which you are allied is most important. This may be par-
tially accomplished by having representatives here; but some-
thing more may be necessary. Hence it is that, in the second
place, we wish to secure your material support.
"J do not know to what extent we may be able to follow the
armies in the field; but, should any great engagement occur, the
number of the wounded will be much larger than the regular
'Service de Sante' can provide for. The hospitals must conse-
quently be dependent, to a very considerable extent, upon volun-
<pb>
tary aid, not only such as may be furnished by surgeons and
nurses, but that which is represented by clothing, food, &c.
"We wish to furnish such material aid, and, moreover, we wish
to introduce, if possible, what we believe to be the most practical
and effective system of hospital management, the merits of which
are most clearly shown by the remarkable military statistics of
our late war. We would establish, for example, a tent hospital,
or one or more pavilion barracks, put the same under the direc-
tion of American surgeons, and treat the inmates as we treated
our own soldiers, confident that we should obtain the same
results. We believe it to be the time, aside from considerations
of practical beneficence, which I am sure cannot be without their
proper influence upon us, to effect a work of sanitary reform,
that may lead to benefits as substantial and permanent as they
will certainly prove creditable to those who may have contributed
to them.
"But it is impossible for me to-day to enter much into details.
As I am greatly hurried at the present moment, I shall defer
much that I should like to say until at least the next mail.
We wish the American Association to take some immediate
action in view of the troubles which now threaten us, and we have
no doubt it will.
"Believe me,
"Yours very truly,
"Edward A. Crane.
"P. S.—Should a great battle have occurred before you receive
this, or immediately on receiving this, could you not send us a
few hundred dollars' worth of condensed milk, Borden's beef,
desiccated egg, &c. &c? We will be responsible for the payment in
any event. We have to-day telegraphed to New York for ten
American hospital tents. With these we will make a beginning.
—E. A. C."
On the 27th of July, the Committee, through its Secretary,
again addressed the President of that Association on the subject
of its intended action.
This second letter was as follows:—
<pb>
"Paris, 15, Rue de la Paix,
"July 27, 1870.
"Henry W. Bellows, New York.
"My dear Doctor,
"I wrote you by the last mail a brief account of what
we Americans were doing in view of the present war, and of the
opportunities we probably shall have of affording aid to the
wounded. I also at the same time solicited, through you, the
support, as well as recognition, of the 'American Association for
the Relief of the Misery of Battle-fields.'
"I could not, however, give you at that time a clear statement
of what we proposed to do, since our action was necessarily con-
tingent upon such dispositions as the Ministere de la Guerre might
make in favour of voluntary aid, whether patriotic or foreign.
"I am scarcely better able to-day to tell you, in what way we
may be able to accomplish, during the present war, the greatest
good with the means we may have at our disposition.
"We know this much—that we shall be needed, and that we
shall have an opportunity, at least, of showing what we can do.
"As we have offered to the French society (' SocMte de
Secours aux BlesseV) our support, we shall receive in return
their cordial co-operation. When ten thousand wounded French-
men and Germans are to be cared for somehow, we shall have no
difficulty in obtaining from the French Government every facility
we can reasonably ask for. The French Society proposes to send to
each corps d'armie a volunteer ambulance—that is to say, a medical
and surgical staff, with attendants, waggons, stretchers, tents, and
other material, sufficient for the maintenance of a field hospital
of one hundred or more beds. It seems to us best to attempt
something similar, on a scale proportionate to our means.
Should a great battle occur, we would like to establish, on or
near the field, a hospital, to be under our own special direction,
and for the management of which we might become responsible.
We shall have no difficulty in securing here the best American
surgical skill, nor shall we have any difficulty in obtaining the
funds necessary to begin our work with.
<pb>
"Dr. Evans telegraphed to Mr. Ely (22, Pine Street, New-
York) a few days since, to send out immediately ten United
States' regulation hospital tents; these could not be obtained in
Europe, and they seemed to be almost indispensable to the estab-
lishment of an American field hospital. The iron bedsteads,
stretchers, &c., &c., we have ordered to be constructed here, but
after American models.
"Should our tents arrive before any great blow has been
struck, we shall go to the field prepared. Should a great engage-
ment be announced this week, we may go forward with such
means as we have, and do the best we can under the cir-
cumstances.
"I hope the American Association will consider carefully and
conscientiously what it ought to do, not forgetting that every
similar Association in Europe expects something to be done by it.
The English and Austrian Associations are each preparing for the
work before them; and we shall doubtless soon have the generous
concurrence of the Associations of all the neutral powers.
We have formed here a Ladies' branch committee, consisting
of about twenty members, of which Mrs. Anson Burlinghame is
the President, and Mrs. Thomas W. Evans, Vice-President. A
well-attended and interesting meeting was held by the ladies
yesterday, and we shall obtain from them a warin-hearted
support, both in Paris and at the front, should any occasion
require them to be there.
u Mr. Ely telegraphs to-day that our tents have been shipped
by the 'Scotia.'
"Believe me, my dear Doctor,
"Yours very truly,
"Edward A. Crane."
To these letters the Secretary received the following reply:—
"Walpole, N. H.,
"Aug. 13, 1870.
"My dear Doctor,
"Your favours, of July 27 and July 19, have both
reached me, although somewhat behind time, by reason of my
<pb>
o
absence in the country in this terrific summer, which has debili-
tated and scattered everybody. Never were our citizens so hard
to get at! I am too feeble to do much myself at present, being
more than usually worn out and unable to work, and am going
to the Adirondack^ on Tuesday to see what effect the open air
and a colder climate will have. But I have written to New
York, urging Dr. Agnew and Mr. Strong, in the absence of our
colleagues of both Societies (the U. S. San. Com. and the Ameri-
can Association) to take the responsibility of appealing, under our
own signature, to the public for help for the battle-fields of
Europe. I can't say what they will do. I am also in cor-
respondence with Dr. Harris on the same subject. A formal
meeting is out of the question until October 1. If we act, it must
be informally.
"I fear that the Sanitary Commission may think you have
exceeded perfect truth and propriety in calling, in their name,
upon American citizens abroad for assistance; but I trust the
circumstances will be fully taken into account, and the license be
allowed to pass without question. But I know the just sensi-
tiveness of my colleagues to their own rights and duties,
although I cannot speak officially for them.
"When I hear from them, I will write again. It is impossible
to say what they, on the ground, in New York, may think
feasible or judicious to do. But I hope for prompt action.
"Meanwhile I send you the expression of my earnest sym-
pathy with all neutral endeavours for the relief of battle-fields. I
have to-day written to the Count de Flavigny, President of the
Paris Association at the Palais d'Industrie.
"Commend me to Dr. Evans, and believe me,
"Very truly yours,
"H. W. Bellows.
M P. S.—I can pay no direct attention, I regret to say, to your
orders for condensed milk, except to forward your letters to Dr.
Agnew at New York."
This letter, although expressive of a certain personal interest
in the work which the Committee had engaged upon, was not
<pb>
encouraging. Nothing could be done before the 1st of October
—and that when every moment was of vital importance. Indeed,
there were many reasons for believing the war might be finished
before the 1st of October. In short, the purport of the letter was
nearly equivalent to:—" Do not count upon our assistance or our
co-operation in any way with the work you have undertaken."
The letter, however, is chiefly remarkable for a singular miscon-
ception, which exposed the first public act of the Committee to a
gratuitous criticism, and doubtless deeply prejudiced the super-
sensitive members of the American Association against the Paris
Committee from the very outset.
The parties in whose " name," in conjunction with "the name
of a common humanity," the Paris Committee appealed to their
fellow citizens for help in their undertaking, were not the "United
States Sanitary Commission" (a Commission no longer having an
official existence), as erroneously supposed by Dr. Bellows; but
"the humane men and women of Europe," from whom, the appeal
of that body for help during the American war is stated, in the
t: appeal" of the Paris Committee, to have " met with a hearty and
generous response," and the remembrance of which "response,"
the Committee hoped, would suffice to call forth, on the part of
the American Association, and, through it, on the part of the
American people, a corresponding tribute of "hearty and gene-
rous" aid to the suffering soldiers of Europe.
Moreover, as if this misconception might not sufficiently arouse
a sentiment of prejudice on the part of the American Association
towards the Committee, another misconception would appear to
have been brought forward. Dr. Bellows says:—" I can pay no
direct attention, I regret to say, to your orders for condensed milk,
&c." Who could have supposed that the following postscript in
the Secretary's letter of July 19th, should have been construed
as an order addressed to the Association, and, consequently, as
presumptuous, impertinent, and offensive?
"P. S. — Should a great battle have occurred before you
receive this, or immediately on receiving this, could you not send
us a few hundred dollars' worth of condensed milk, Borden's
beef, desiccated egg, &c.,&c.? We will be responsible for the pay-
ment in any event."
<pb>
The Committee never had for a moment entertained the idea
of supplanting the American Association in any portion of the
circle of its legitimate duty, and had only assumed the position
which seemed to be required alike to maintain its existence and
its usefulness; its single purpose was to make itself useful in the
largest way, and to initiate at the very beginning of a threatened
war the repayment of that debt of obligation which European
generosity during our own war had imposed upon us as American
citizens, and long continued European hospitalities had no less
imposed upon us as American residents in France and Germany.
In pursuance of the same endeavour to interest the American
people in the great conflict then pending, the Committee next
addressed itself to Dr. Elisha Harris, who had formerly been one
of the most influential members of the United States Sanitary
Commission. This gentleman replied as follows:—
"New Brighton,
"Statcn Island, New York.
"Atigust 24, 1870.
"To the Secretary of the 'American International Sanitary
Committee.'
"My dear Doctor,
"The friends of humanity in our country yearn, with
deepest sympathy, for the wounded in the terrible struggle now
in progress in France. Our sympathy would find expression in
earnest activities were not the Atlantic between us. And even
now we must act.
"Neutrality is enjoined; but we can give money, and I hope our
people will be so fully informed of the precise methods of succour,
and the actual demands for pecuniary means and personal aid,
that you shall not neglect to do any service you ought to do, or
possibly can do, for humanity.
"Of course we must be kept fully advised regarding the
methods, facilities, and demands for your volunteer aid to the
sick and wounded. The ' American Association for Relief will
meet as soon as its members return to the city. We are now
widely scattered, have no funds, and only an organization and a
plan.
<pb>
"But until this association shall have begun its good work—
say in October—I will freely do, individually, all in my power to
aid your Parisian Association for succour. I can secure for the
ambulance and hospital service much skilled and experienced
personal aid—persons who read and speak French. Have you
means for employing or securing engagements for such surgeons?
"The raising of funds would not be difficult, if it were to be
known that all this voluntary aid is neutral and common in its
administration. Is not the Parisian Association able to give some
assurance of this kind?
"Every city and hamlet in France ought to have a perfect
system of co-operation for succour. It was universality, catho-
licity, and patriotism, that gave us our wonderful control of
material aid and unbounded sympathy in the United States, as
you know. Our hearts bleed for the 100,000 wounded that have
already fallen between the Saar and the Moselle. God grant
that an honourable peace, and the preservation of the national
rights and autonomies may soon be vouchsafed! My heart is
with your association in all its endeavours and anxious labours.
"With most friendly memories,
"And my lasting respects,
"I remain yours,
"Elisha Harris."
This answer was so warmly approbative and cordial, that the
Committee felt itself justified in regarding it as the prelude to
the "responsive" co-operation so greatly desired by it, on the
part of their fellow-citizens. But the pleasing illusion was des-
tined to be dispelled in the sequel; for, as will be shown in this
history, not one particle of assistance, either in money, kind, or
counsel, was ever received by the Paris Committee—notwith-
standing their repeated appeals, during the entire duration of
the Franco-German war—from those who had been the repre-
sentatives of a magnificent example of civilian philanthropy, and
who had also themselves received such generous European aid,
during the great struggle in the United States.
In striking contrast with the indifference manifested by the
American Association to the efforts made by the Paris Committee
to popularize, in Europe, the important reforms which the Sanitary
<pb>
Commission had been largely instrumental in introducing into the
ambulance service of the United States, were the promptitude and
efficiency with which the Government of that country responded to
the call telegraphed to it by the Paris Committee, on the 19th of
July, for ten of its hospital tents. These tents, through the
kindness of General Meigs, were immediately forwarded to the
Committee, and reached Liverpool within a fortnight of the
sending of the telegram. And curiously illustrative, also, of the
dilatoriness of proceedings in the Old World is the fact that,
although eleven days had sufficed to bring the much-desired
tents from Washington to Liverpool, and although the shipping
agents in that town had been instructed to forward them to
Paris, immediately on their arrival, by the speediest route,
regardless of expense, such and so many were the delays occa-
sioned by custom houses, trans-shipments, and railway arrange-
ments on both sides of the Channel, that these tents, which were,
in fact, the indispensable pivot of the Committee's undertaking,
only reached Paris on the 22nd of August—that is to say, after
several great battles had already been fought.
The Paris Committee, disappointed in its hope of obtaining
pecuniary assistance from their countrymen in America, had in
the meantime set diligently to work to obtain funds and aid from
Americans in Europe. They published urgent appeals in various
newspapers, issued circulars, and addressed demands for help to
individuals in every direction; but they had only succeeded in
obtaining, during the months of July and August, about 19,000
francs. Determined, however, to carry out its programme by
"hook or by crook," the Committee appointed Dr. Marion Sims
to be the surgeon-in-chief of its future hospital, with authority
to organize the requisite surgical staff; it purchased materials of
every kind, laid in stores of food, medicines, &c., and pushed on
its various preparations for fitting up its hospital as soon as the
tents should arrive.
An attempt was made to organize a "Ladies' branch com-
mittee," as a co-operative and subordinate association. But many of
the ladies who had intended taking part in it were forced to leave
town, and the "Branch" as a distinct organization soon ceased
to exist. Nevertheless a good many ladies used to meet daily for the
<pb>
purpose of giving their aid to the cause, in the rooms of the Com-
mittee in the Rue de la Paix, where they made ready a liberal
supply of linen, lint, bandages, clothing, &c., for the forty or
fifty beds of the ambulance which the Committee proposed to
establish. Conspicuous for zeal and perseverance in this group
of lady workers were Mrs. and Miss Parnell, and Mrs. Koch, and
Miss Benson, among its American members, and the Misses
Bewick among its English ones; but all laboured diligently and
effectually, and rendered valuable service in preparing the in-
struments of the benevolent work upon which the Committee
was anxiously desirous to enter, while several of them continued
to give welcome and efficient assistance to the Committee to the
end of its labours.
The undertaking, which the latter had carried on under so
many difficulties was, meantime, gradually assuming a definite
form. Its tents had at length reached Paris, and the exertions
of the Committee had succeeded in getting everything ready for
organizing in them the hospital accommodations required for the
reception of the patients, for whose treatment the proportions of
this first American Ambulance had been combined. In addition
to the objects obtained and prepared by the Committee, the
president had placed at its disposal the whole of the large and
valuable sanitary collection exhibited by him in 1867, and which
had subsequently been maintained as a permanent exhibition,
comprising four tents, six ambulance and medicine-waggons,
medicines and medicine-panniers, surgical instruments, appa-
ratus, and appliances, hospital-furniture, bedding, clothing, &c.,
&c. The Committee had also procured a large quantity of
anaesthetics (especially of ether), and had laid in a good supply
of stores, including wines, preserved beef, biscuit, candles and can-
dlesticks, though it had not burdened itself with the addition of
"The butcher, the baker,
And candlestick maker,"
which the traditional " regulations " of the French ambulance
system would probably have attached to its "establishment."
The exceeding cumbersomeness and consequent inefficiency of
the French ambulance system (which is still, in the main, what it
c
<pb>
was a hundred and fifty years ago), had, indeed, suggested
serious doubts to the organizers of the attempt whose history is
here recorded, as to the possibility of any practical co-operation
on their part with the official and extra-official arrangements made
for taking care of the wounded, and led them to anxiously con-
sider whether they would not be better able to carry out their
special design by retaining a footing of complete independence.
The cumbrous nature of the system alluded to, and, yet more, the
utterly insufficient numerical proportions of its medical staff,
render it entirely incapable of grappling with the formidable diffi-
culties which we have seen to be inseparable from the results of a
hostile encounter between the enormous masses of men brought
together for purposes of mutual slaughter, by the vast de-
velopments of modern strategy; while the official routine of the
French army, requiring each ambulance to follow the movements
of the division to which it is attached, often compels the surgeons
to leave their patients after a short period of treatment, so that
they rarely witness the completion of any of the cases whose
treatment they have begun, and have perhaps carried on to a
certain point.
It was evident, therefore, that even if the American ambu-
lance could obtain official permission to attach itself to the sani-
tary service of the French army (a permission which, being com-
posed of foreigners, it was by no means sure of obtaining), it
could not do so without sacrificing the special object which it
had proposed to itself to accomplish, and to the realization of
which the permanence of its hospital, to an extent which might
enable it to carry on the treatment of the same patients to the
completion of their cure, was an indispensable condition. The
Committee, therefore, determined to retain the independent foot-
ing accorded to it and to other international Associations by the
terms of the Convention of Geneva, which had been formally
adopted by the French Government; and to go forward to some
suitable locality, as soon as the theatre of the war should have
been marked out with sufficient distinctness to allow of its ascer-
taining the precise spot most desirable for the establishment of
its hospital. But the Committee soon found that it was by no
means easy to decide where that spot was to be found.
<pb>
Moreover, when the war first began, everyone supposed that
the conflict, whatever might be its issue, would be waged on
German soil; and the Paris Committee, sharing the general
illusion, had expected to establish its hospital at some convenient
point on the eastern side of the Rhine. But the progress
of events soon rendered it evident that the war, instead of being
carried into Germany, would be fought out on the territory of
the presupposed invader; while the successive defeats of the
French forces, the incessant changes which, as will be remem-
bered, occurred from week to week, and almost from day to
day, in the scene and direction of the military movements which
succeeded one another with such startling rapidity, - rendered it
impossible for the Committee to fix upon any locality in which
it might hope to effect such an establishment of its hospital as
would enable it to accomplish the aim it had mainly in view—
viz., the offering to the inspection of the governments and army
surgeons of Europe, a practical illustration of the value of the
modifications which had been introduced into the sanitary ser-
vice of the United States, during the War of the Rebellion, by
the joint action of the civilian and official elements. The Com-
mittee sent out agents to Chalons, Metz, and other places which
were assuming importance as possibly destined to be the scene
of more protracted operations than had hitherto taken place.
But the French forces were constantly falling back, and the tide
of war seemed to be so steadily setting in towards Paris, that it
became a question whether this city might not prove, after all, to
be the best place for the contemplated establishment of the
American ambulance.
The Committee, however, notwithstanding these uncertainties,
worked on as diligently as though its path were already marked
out for it; being quite sure that, whether in or out of Paris, it
could not fail to find a fitting field for the rendering of all the aid it
would be in its power to give. By the 22nd of August all the
preparations for an ambulance were fully completed; its packages
were made, and its personnel and belongings were ready to
start for any point of the compass at an hour's notice. From
the 22nd to the 26th, the one question most anxiously discussed
by the Committee was, " Shall we go, or shall we stay?"
<pb>
The surgeon-in-chief was most impatient to leave Paris, as
were also the persons attached to his staff. The theatre of war,
just after the bloody battles of Gravelotte and Saint Privat,
was irresistibly attractive to those curious to experience in their
own persons the sensational excitement of witnessing the scenes
of the terrible drama which was then being acted. Something
of the surgery of the war might also be seen with profit to them-
selves, however uncertain might be the chances of their render-
ing any substantial aid to the wounded and the suffering. Two
members of the committee—one himself attached to the surgical
staff—were also in favour of going " somewhere to the front,"
although not one of those who were so impatient to go somewhere,
had the slightest notion of where there was a probability that his
services might be needed, or ventured to suggest where he really
wished to go, or even possessed one particle of information with
regard either to the probable relations which a foreign volunteer
ambulance might establish within the lines of an active army, or
to the means of transporting its material and personnel a single
mile over a military road. The president, uninfluenced by those
motives which were acting most powerfully upon the surgical
staff, concerned chiefly about the interests of the ambulance
itself, and responsible for the success of the ambulance, not only
to the public by reason of the contributions then received, but
also largely personally responsible for its eventual maintenance
and support, was decidedly of opinion that the greatest chance
of usefulness might be secured by waiting in Paris for some sea-
sonable and favourable opportunity.
First; because of the rapid and incessant shifting of the theatre
of the war, which threatened to necessitate a perpetual shifting
of the ambulance, from place to place.
Secondly; because of the extreme excitement and exasperation
of the public mind, which, suspecting a Prussian and a spy in every
one not officially connected with the army, and particularly in every
foreigner, might have seriously compromised the safety of the
personnel of the ambulance, as well as its usefulness.
Thirdly; because of the smallness of the pecuniary resources at
the disposal of the Committee, which, on the one hand, rendered it
unwise to waste those resources in moving about the country at a
<pb>
venture, on the changing track of forces whose probable position
it was impossible to foresee from day to day; and, on the other
hand, would render a large additional outlay indispensable,
unless the ambulance was to be broken up and dissolved, after a
few days of amateur campaigning and sight-seeing.
Fourthly; because it was necessary for the ambulance to pre-
serve its independence, which it could not do if attached to a
division or corps d'armee ; a position, it may be observed, which,
although claimed, it is highly improbable would have then been
accorded to it.
Fifthly; because of the wholly undefined relations, to the inten-
dance and military authorities, of the volunteer ambulance corps,
whether national or foreign.
Sixthly; because in an interview which he had the honour of
holding, on the morning of the 26th of August, with the Minister
of War, and the representative of the Government at the Foreign
Office, he was assured that no guarantees could be given of the
recognition of the ambulance as an "American Ambulance" at
the headquarters of any army corps; as also, that no special
passports could be accorded to it, and that any movement to the
front must be made at the risk and peril of the ambulance, as
well in regard to its material as to its personnel.
Seventhly, and finally; because of the constantly increasing
probability that Paris, and its immediate neighbourhood, would
become the scene of the final and most sanguinary act in the
terrible drama of the war.
On the 26th of August the question of "going" or " staying"
was once more thoroughly and anxiously discussed. Those who
were desirous of making an immediate dash to the front, set forth
their view of the case, and urged an immediate decision in its
favour. More than ever convinced of the impolicy of moving at
the moment when the German armies were rapidly converging
upon Paris, when "the mountain " in fact "was coming to us,"
the president was, nevertheless, willing to let the question be
decided, then and there, by a vote of the majority.
The question was accordingly put to the vote ; but the result
was a tie, half the members voting for an immediate move, the
other half voting not to move, but to await in Paris until events
<pb>
should have more clearly revealed the course to be pursued. The
question was, therefore, undecided. Those who were in favour of
going forward now advised that application should be made to
the French "Societe' de Secours aux Blesess" for funds, and
the ambulance be thus made subordinate to that Association; a
proposition which was disapproved by the rest of the Com-
mittee, as alike fatal to its own independence, and to the very
aim the ambulance was mainly intended to subserve. If it was
found to be impossible to maintain a distinctly American organi-
zation, it appeared to them that the sooner the Committee was
dissolved the better, and for the very sufficient reason that it had
been created for a specific purpose, and had delegated to it no
powers to act in any other way than as the visible and immediate
agent of American sympathy and'benevolence.
It was particularly unfortunate, at this time, when the Com-
mittee needed all its strength, that one of its five members—
Colonel James McKaye, was compelled to leave Paris. This
gentleman having had a large experience in administrative affairs,
would have been a wise counsellor, and thoroughly convinced as
he was, of the inexpediency of engaging upon any doubtful and
uncertain movement, would at least have relieved the Committee
by his vote, of the awkward embarrassment of an equal division.
On the 31st of August, Colonel McKaye wrote to the secretary
from Geneva, warmly endorsing the resolution which had been
supported by the president and himself, as the only one which
could have reasonably been entertained, in view of the special and
general circumstances which were influencing the action of the
Committee, and which it would have been impossible to ignore.
"I am entirely," says he, "of the opinion that, in the present
state of the war, and with the almost perfect certainty that the
seat of the war will be shortly transferred to the vicinity of Paris,
our hospital had better be set up in that city. If you had
the means, and could without delay reach the field of the battle
which is probably now going on, between MacMahon and the
Crown Prince, you might do a great service, but as you have not
the means of doing so, I advise you to prepare and wait, for my
opinion is that you will have need of all your means and all
your efforts, before many weeks, within the walls of Paris."
<pb>
The divergence of opinion which existed within the Com-
mittee was destined, however, to be definitively settled by the
incidents of the meeting referred to. One member of the Com-
mittee, and the whole of its surgical staff withdrew.
As it may perhaps seem to the reader that these passages in
the general history of our Committee have been presented in too
strong a light; it should be observed that they not only relate to
matters which, at the time, threatened the very existence of the
Committee, but that they also bring into relief those principles of
action, which subsequently became the ground-work of whatever
successes the ambulance may have finally attained. History, in
determining the wisdom of a plan, seldom cares to know anything
more than its results; but the plan which was considered by a
majority of the Committee to be, under the circumstances, the
wisest and the most expedient, as well as the motives by which
they were influenced, should be clearly stated—and this, we trust,
has been done.
The three gentlemen who were now left to represent the Com-
mittee, having very soon decided to remain in Paris, and to pro-
ceed immediately to the organization of an ambulance in that
city, addressed a letter to Dr. John Swinburne, then in London,
inviting him to come over to Paris, and take charge of its surgical
department.
Having decided to make Paris the scene of its operations, the
Committee communicated its intentions to General Bosq, general-
in-chief of the French Intendance, and to Dr. Michael Levy,
chief health officer to the French army, both of whom felici-
tated the Committee most warmly on the decision amved at, and
assured it, that its efforts would in all probability be far more
useful in Paris than they could be elsewhere.
The use of a fine plot of ground, of over an acre, in the
Avenue de l'lmperatrice, No. 36, had been obtained from
Monsieur Le Prince and Madame La Princesse de Bauffremont;
and upon that ground, the Committee had the satisfaction of
setting up, on the 1st of September, its two rows of roomy and
airy tents, with its " Round Tent" advantageously placed in the
centre of the plot.
As a precautionary measure, in view of the increasing gravity
<pb>
of affairs at the front, the rapid advances of the German armies,
and the excitement and panic which prevailed in Paris in con-
sequence of the threatened transference of the field of conflict to
its immediate vicinity, it was now proposed (and by virtue of
the clause in the Resolution passed on the 18th of July, em-
powering the Committee to add to their number) to increase the
Committee by the addition of two more members. Mr. J. W.
Tucker and the Rev. Wm, 0. Lamson were accordingly elected
members on the 2nd of September; the first as Treasurer of the
Committee, the second as its Storekeeper. It was also resolved
to make another appeal to the Americans in Paris, not only for
pecuniary aid, but for the formation of a corps of volunteer
stretcher-bearers and nurses from among the young Americans
whose social position might enable them to devote their services,
gratuitously, to the task which each day's events were so evi-
dently bringing nearer and nearer.
The fateful 4th of September, 1870, will not soon be forgotten
by those who spent that day in the capital of France. The
weather was magnificent. The beautiful city, in all the pride of
its stately architecture, its broad thoroughfares, its long lines
and clusters of noble trees, was arched over by a sky of cloudless
azure, radiant with the glory of a warm autumnal sun. The
Boulevards were thronged with promenaders, the Place de la
Concorde was crowded; but the usual gaiety of Paris on a
sunny day was replaced by the restlessness of anxious presenti-
ment, apparent in every countenance. For the glowing, trans-
parent air was thick with dark shadows of impending trouble,
and heavy with conflicting rumours of some great disaster;
shadows and rumours destined to be merged, as the day went
on, in the certainty of a catastrophe so immense, so complete,
so overwhelming, that the annals of the world could scarcely
show a parallel to it. The rage of the great city, the downfall
of the Empire, the establishment of the "Government of the Na-
tional Defence," at three o'clock, at the Hotel de Ville, the irrup-
tion of the yelling and infuriated crowd into the Tuileries, and
the flight of the Empress, are matters of history, yet—however
dramatic, however closely identified with the fortunes of the
American ambulance—they are beyond the scope of this report.
<pb>
Suffice it to say, in this place, that the illustrious Lady, who,
from the date of her elevation to the throne of France, had
taken so warm and active an interest in the relief of every form
of suffering and distress, whether in hospitals or in the homes of
the poor, and who had given to the plans and efforts of the
International Sanitary Associations an amount of protection
and support second only to that which had been bestowed upon
them by the Queen of Prussia—on the afternoon of the 4th of
September, deserted by all around her, found herself alone, save
a single companion, at the eastern gate of the Louvre, and in the
midst of a mob wild with the first frenzy of revolution.
Nothing but her own brave self-reliance at the moment saved
her. She immediately sought and found a refuge in the house
of the writer of this narrative. Unfortunately it could offer no
assurance of permanent security; this could only be obtained by
an escape from France—and the success of such an undertaking
would evidently depend principally upon the promptitude with
which it might be conducted. Whatever the claims of private
interest might be—with whatever of regret the abandonment of
a work which had enlisted all his sympathies might be attended—
here was a still stronger claim for sympathy, and one which
appealed as well to the commonest sense of duty and of honour.
The Empress had entrusted her personal safety to him, and
more than willingly, he accepted all the responsibilities it in-
volved. He suddenly left Paris, without giving a word of ex-
planation to any one, and after a few days happily succeeded
in conducting Her Majesty, in safety, to the more secure and
peaceful shores of England.
Dr. Crane was kind enough to accompany the writer a little
way on this eventful journey; and, owing to various special circum-
stances, he only reached Paris on the following Thursday,
where the sudden and unexplained absence of the president and
secretary had plunged the Committee into a sea of wonderment
and uneasiness that may be readily imagined. The position of
the members of that body, in the absence of those by whom they
found themselves, as it appeared to them, so unaccountably aban-
doned just when their presence was most necessary, was in fact,
sufficiently embarrassing. Left without direction or means of
<pb>
action, and their new surgeon not having yet arrived, it will scarcely
be wondered at that the secretary, on returning to his post in the
Rue de la Paix, should have found that the work of preparation
had come to a standstill, and that the members of the Committee
were half inclined to consider the undertaking as being virtually
at an end!
Nor was this all, the apparently sudden disappearance of the
president, which for reasons easily to be understood, could
not be immediately explained, gave rise to various scandalous
imputations as to the motives of his mysterious departure.
These aspersions, which found their way into the public press
of Europe, and even of America, were, however, much less a
matter of personal concern to him, than a subject of regret in so
far as they might call in question the honour of others, and
expose the work of the Committee itself to the attacks of the
malevolent.
Fortunately, the return pf the secretary, and the arrival in Paris
of Dr. Swinburne, restored the action of the Committee to its
former vigour, and the work of organizing its ambulance was
carried on with the utmost activity, in the confident expectation
that the speedy return of the president would place the under-
taking upon the satisfactory footing which its appeals to the
generosity of the public had hitherto failed to secure.
The president, on his side, so unexpectedly called from Paris in
the discharge of an unforeseen responsibility, had no idea that his
absence from that city would extend beyond the few days re-
quired to secure the safety of the illustrious lady who had con-
fided to him the care of ensuring her escape.
He had, accordingly, when separating from the secretary, advised
him principally concerning such action as might be immediately
required on his return to Paris. But in order that the work
might in no way be compromised by the hazard of a prolonged
absence, the president as a precautionary measure, gave to the
secretary a written authorization to act as his representative
in the council of the Committee, and in the direction of the
ambulance.
On reaching London, the president wrote to the secretary
announcing the fact of his safe arrival, and at the same time his
<pb>
purpose of speedily returning ; but, being greatly occupied, he did
not write to him at length, as he fully intended to return to Paris
in the course of a few days. But the preparations for the siege
rendering it every day more and more doubtful, whether, if he
returned to Paris, he would be able to get out again (as the
prosecution of the original plans in regard to the action of an
American International Sanitary Committee, rendered it impera-
tively necessary that he should be able to do), he was compelled to
linger in London, waiting, from day to day, for such indications of
the probable course of events as might enable him to come to a
decision as to the feasibility of his return. But the unexpected
rapidity with which the operations for laying siege to Paris were
carried forward, and the increasing probability that the Germans
would succeed in their attempt to compass an investment which,
when their plans first became apparent, appeared to all on-
lookers to be an utter impossibility, speedily convinced the
president that, even if he could succeed in getting back to Paris, it
would be vain to hope he could leave it again; and he therefore
determined to remain in London, in order to secure the personal
freedom of movement essential to the carrying out of his
intended action in relation to the sanitary interests of the war.
In order to guarantee the Paris ambulance against any crippling
of its energies through lack of funds, in view of his unexpected
absence from the field of its labours, he sent a carte blanche
authorization to the secretary to draw upon Messrs. de Roths-
child for any amounts that might be required for the fullest
development of its possibilities of action during the siege.
But although the completion of the investment was not offi-
cially announced until the 18th of September, all communica-
tion between Paris and the outside world was virtually cut off
some days before that date; and the letter, containing the
authorization alluded to, only reached the secretary some time in
December. That gentleman, on his side, wrote repeatedly to the
president; but his letters, like those addressed to him, were only
received towards the middle of the siege, and then irregularly,
so rigorously was the suspension of postal communication main-
tained throughout its duration.
Uncertain, under this suspension, whether his authorization had,
<pb>
or had not, reached Paris, the president made three subsequent
attempts to convey to the secretary, through different channels,
the authorization alluded to. But none of these succeeded; and
not a word was received by either party from the other until the
month of December.
Finding that no action was being taken by the American
Association in regard to the great struggle that had so suddenly
broken out in Europe, and being more desirous than ever of
obtaining the valuable assistance which that body was presumed
to be so well qualified to give, the Committee in Paris, in view
of the^new aspect assumed by the war, determined to make
one more attempt to enlist the active sympathy of their country-
men in behalf of the ambulance ; and, to this end, passed the
following resolutions:—
"Resolved,—That circumstances having prevented the re-
moval of the staff and material of this Committee from Paris, it
now finds itself, in view of the threatened siege of the city, in the
immediate prospect of the largest need of all its resources, and
to greatly,.extend and prolong its work, large expenditures would
be required, far exceeding the means remaining in the treasury.
It must, therefore, at once take a decision either to remain quite
inadequate to the requirements of the wounded during the
threatened siege, or to go forward boldly with firm confidence
in the ample support of the friends of humanity in the United
States. They prefer the latter course, feeling that their con-
fidence will be fully justified, and that the contributions, for
which they cannot wait, will be readily offered to pay the debts
which must be incurred to carry on the great work of charity to
the wounded and suffering which now lies before them. They
beg, therefore, that prompt and vigorous efforts may be set on
foot by their friends at home, in order that their obligations may
be fully met, and that the American people may show themselves
second to no other in generous response to this loud call upon
the sympathies of the world."
Besolved,—" That the secretary be instructed to communicate
the foregoing resolution, accompanied by an urgent appeal from
himself, to the proper parties at home for publication."
The secretary accordingly drew up a new and pressing "ap-
<pb>
peal" for pecuniary aid, as eloquent and forcible as he was able
to make it, which, with a copy of the foregoing resolutions, and
the following letter, was sent to Dr. Elisha Harris—with the
request that the resolutions be published in the American
papers:—
"Paris, 15, Rue de la Paii,
"Sept. Kith, 1870.
"Dr. Elisha Harris, New York.
"My Dear Doctor,
"Your letter of September 1st has much interested
us. We thank you very much for your kind expressions of
sympathy for the unhappy victims of this fearful war, as also for
the good-will you manifest towards us, who have endeavoured
to do what we have felt it to be our duty to do, not only as
Americans, but as men.
"It is impossible for me in a single hurried letter to fully ex-
plain to you our present position, or at least the causes which
have occasioned it. We have all believed that more or less
success would attend the French army during this campaign. Our
preparations were made in this belief—How we have been dis-
appointed all the world knows!
"A series of remarkable defeats and retreats—the dead and
wounded left in the hands of the Germans invariably; the volun-
teer ambulances of the French society unable to act, constantly
under orders to fall back upon Paris, and crippled from the be-
ginning by their subordination to an intendance as despotic as it
was inefficient; our relations as an independent foreign ambu-
lance undetermined; a subscription list so small that I should
be ashamed as an American to report it ; an attack upon Paris
itself, constantly expected by the government, which was em-
ploying all its resources to meet it. These facts have caused us
to feel, that the wisest course for us to pursue was to remain in
Paris, and establish our hospital here. I may also say that our
conclusion was partially determined by the advice given to us by
officers of the government, several of whom have urged us by all
means to establish our hospital in Paris. . .
<pb>
"Our tents, fourteen in number, have been pitched on a
beautiful piece of ground, j ust within the walls of the city, and
before to-morrow night, we shall have fifty beds prepared to
receive the wounded who may be sent from the fortifications.
The French medical inspector who visited us to-day expressed
very warmly the satisfaction which the inspection of our instal-
lation had afforded him, and referred to it as a substantial ex-
pression of sympathy from the great American Republic towards
her younger sister. I am afraid, however, unless our friends at
home come forward to help us, we shall fail to do all that is ex-
pected of us.
"We have been prevented from going forward with the army,
to a large extent, by a want of the means. I certainly should
be unable to conceal my mortification, if our modest proposal to
maintain a hospital here, should fail to meet with any response
from the people of the United States—so many of whom have
enjoyed, in happier times, the hospitalities of this imperial city.
"Enclosed I send you some resolutions, &c.
"Believe me, my dear Doctor,
"Yours, very sincerely,
"Edward A. Crane."
To this new attempt to obtain help from the United States no
answer was ever received.
The Paris Committee, meantime, exerted itself diligently to
maintain itself in activity. Reduced, by the circumstances
referred to, to the lowest degree of impecuniosity, and having
found that no sufficient help was to be obtained in the form of
donations, the Committee was under the necessity of resorting to
the expedient of borrowing money, and contracting debts, making
themselves jointly responsible for their repayment. But the loans
thus raised were soon expended. The purchases of bedsteads and
blankets, of surgical apparatus, and other objects of elementary
necessity for the completion of the arrangements of the ambulance,
absorbed nearly the whole of the amounts thus obtained; and
the enterprise would have been brought to an end, just when its
material conditions had been entirely completed, had not the
secretary determined to lay the state of the case before Colonel
<pb>
Lloyd Lindsay, Chairman of the British National Aid Society
(who had succeeded in obtaining an entrance into the beleaguered
city about the middle of October) and endeavour to obtain from
the ample funds which the English subscription had placed in
his hands for the relief of the French wounded, the loan of a
sum sufficient to enable it to go on with its undertaking. This
application was received in the kindest and most liberal manner
by Colonel Lindsay, who desired the secretary to name the
amount he thought necessary, and handed to the latter, at his
request, a sum of 20,000/r. which the receiver expressly stipulated
should be regarded only as a loan, to be repaid as soon as possible.
This seasonable aid enabled the Committee to continue its efforts
for a time ; and, moreover, the return of Colonel Lindsay to
London offered to it an opportunity of communicating its con-
dition to the president, who at once repaid to Colonel Lindsay
the sum he had advanced to the secretary, and took new measures
to transmit to that gentleman an authorization to draw on him
personally, through the house of the Messrs. de Rothschilds, for
such sums as might be necessary to carry on and complete the
work. This authorization did not arrive, however, until the
sum advanced by Colonel Lindsay had been exhausted, and
the Committee had been compelled to effect a new loan to the
amount of 20,000 francs, contracted with the house of Mallet
Freres—for whose obliging generosity in this matter, the Com-
mittee will always feel under deep obligations.
Towards the close of December, the president received from
Dr. Elisha Harris the following letter:—
"New York,
"Dec. 7th, 1870.
"To Thomas W. Evans, M.D. Ph. D., President of the American
International Sanitary Committee, London and Paris.
"Dear Doctor,
"In the terrible struggle of the French for the salvation
of their nationality, your grand endeavours to give succour to
the sick and wounded, under the Red Cross, will become a
chapter in the story of the war.
<pb>
"We, in America, rejoice that your efforts have not been
thwarted by the siege, and that, while in England, you are still
able to press forward the cause of humanity, which finds its
brightest illustration inj;he American Ambulance in the Avenue
de l'lmperatrice.
"We began to collect funds for the Red Cross Service, but
soon found that it was better to urge on the contributions
through the channels which the two nationalities concerned in
the war had formed. This was an imperative decision of the
moneyed representatives of our cause. And although it now
prevents us in New York from contributing to the international
funds, the aggregate result of American contributions is increased.
If the siege of Paris continues, New York must send donations
to the American Sanitary Committee in Paris. And if the siege
should be raised soon would not your ambulance and the Com-
mittee require even greater resources? I am of the opinion that
an appeal from you, as president of the American Committee at
Paris, would insure a rich return to the cause from your country-
men in America. Whenever the good time comes for the return
of the French soldiers from Germany—from distant hospitals—
we hope that your ambulance waggons and railway ambulance
trains will be on duty. The benedictions of ten thousand homes
will be showered on you, sir, for the grand endeavours and
munificent gifts by which your faith in a good cause has been
expressed and illustrated.
"With cordial regards,
"I remain, truly yours,
"Elisha Harris, M.D."
Induced by this letter to believe, that a direct appeal to the
American people for assistance might lead to some substantial
expression of interest, at least in the special work of the Com-
mittee in Paris; the following appeal was prepared for publica-
tion in the American press.
"London, Jan. 1st, 1871.
"To the American Public.
"Acting on the earnest and pressing recommendations contained
in a letter recently received from Dr. Elisha Harris, we avail
<pb>
ourselves of the opportunity which it affords us of appealing to
the sympathies of the United States, in support of the efforts of
the American International Sanitary Committee.
"It is unnecessary for us to enlarge on the results already
achieved by its labours. The disinterested testimony of the
correspondents of the leading English and French journals has
kept the world regularly informed of the extent to which it has
succeeded in alleviating the sufferings of the dying and wounded
of both armies. Our compatriots cannot but be deeply gratified
at this, and they must feel additional pride in the personal
gallantry and devotion of the American medical officers and
assistants engaged in this perilous but glorious service. Great,
however, as is their zeal or that of the Committee, they will
unhappily be unable to meet the increased demands which will
be made on their resources during the remainder of the cam-
paign. Dr. Harris's active and far-seeing benevolence has
enabled him to appreciate the fact, and therefore inspired by his
suggestions, as well as impelled by the exigencies in which our
Committee is engaged, we urgently ask such further aid as the
ever active sympathies and benevolence of our compatriots on
the other side of the Atlantic may be disposed to afford us.
"We are all the more entitled to their co-operation, from the
fact that our society is the only one in Europe, now giving succour
to the wounded, which can be said to be distinctively American.
"Subscriptions in furtherance of our labours will be received
by the following banking houses.

<pb>
It is doubtful if this appeal was ever published—it is certain
that it elicited no reply. Indeed, not a dollar was ever sent from
the United States in aid of the American ambulance, whether in
response to private or public calls for help. That it is possible
to make such a statement, is not the fault of the American
people. Let the responsibility rest with those to whom it belongs
—with those who assumed at the time to be, in the United
States, the organs of American international charity.
For any personal effort which Dr. Elisha Harris, of New
York, or any individual member of the "American Association,"
may have made in their behalf, the Committee will always
entertain a grateful appreciation.
It may be as well to state in this place, by way of completing
the pecuniary history of the American ambulance, that, although
the Committee was frequently assured of receiving support from
various quarters, it seemed always destined in the end to be dis-
appointed. Thus encouraged to believe that it would receive "its
proportional share " of the large donation of 500,000 francs sent
by the British National Aid Society, " for distribution among the
ambulances of Paris," sharing as probably did most of the in-
dependent ambulances in this generous international liberality,
it got nothing, unless it may have been concealed in occasional
gifts on the part of the French "Societe de Secours aux
Blesses" of a little wine, a few pots of jelly, pairs of shoes, and
other objects of similar character, the whole of which, however,
were not worth in any sense more than three or four thousand
francs. With the exception of this trifling aid and the sums
collected by the Committee on its first formation, and a few
thousand francs' worth of articles of clothing and food, con-
tributed at various times by the charitably-disposed residents
of Paris, and the generous and unsolicited gift (5,000 francs),
of an English gentleman—Sir Richard Wallace—the entire cost of
maintaining the ambulance from first to last, was met by the
president, who was also left to assume the liquidation of the
debts contracted by the Committee. This is not said with any
desire to call attention to the amount of pecuniary aid which the
president may have extended to the ambulance, but to show
how completely it was abandoned by those upon whom it had
<pb>
the largest claim for sympathy and support, whether considered
simply as a benevolent enterprise, or as a work which, from an in-
ternational point of view, was reflecting while in operation—which
always will reflect—more credit upon the American people than
has come from all the gifts combined which were aimlessly sent
from America to France, during the continuance of the Franco-
German war.
The writer of this report can never forget, that when the
gentlemen who had formed the Executive Committee of the
"United States Sanitary Commission " having declined to make an
exhibit at the Exposition Universelle of 1867, he offered to
make, at his own expense, an exhibition of the hospital and
sanitary appliances used in the United States during the War of
the Rebellion, he was said by certain persons to have "brought
himself too prominently forward," one of the commissioners even
pronouncing the proposition, with a singularly patriotic appre-
ciation, to be—" A sharp Yankee trick." Such is the "generous
response" which men often accord, when an attempt is made to
accomplish single-handed, what they themselves have abandoned!
When a meeting of American citizens was called on the 18th
of July, 1870, to consider what action should be taken in the
matter of offering relief to the sick and wounded during the
then impending war, the call was made with the sincere wish
and intention of merging individual liberalities and personal
interests, in a general co-operative and patriotic work. If the
financial history of the American ambulance brings into relief
too strongly any one person, such a position was never sought,
and the fault, should it be considered one, must be answered
for by those who would have suffered a work of charity
to die, and who, by their indifference, would have been instru-
mental in turning what had already become a national honour
into a national disgrace. Whatever may be the satisfaction of
the writer himself in having contributed in any way to the
relief of the suffering incident to the late war, in having en-
deavoured to improve the ambulance service of European armies,
by maintaining in the field an active American hospital—such
satisfaction will always be diminished when he remembers that
some of his own countrymen at home were so deaf to every
<pb>
appeal as to leave to a few Americans abroad, the responsibility
as well as the honour of sustaining a work, which always must
hold a memorable place in the history of the siege of Paris. But
to return to the more immediate purpose of this Report.
The fine, open character of the large piece of ground on which
the American ambulance was established, enabled its organizers
to give to it a gay and agreeable aspect rarely found to be
associated with hospital-work. Its white tents, surmounted by
the American, French, and International flags, its beds of gay
flowers, its orange and pomegranate bushes in green tubs, its
little grove and scattered trees, its two lofty flag-staffs, one of
which displayed the star-spangled banner of the United States,
while from the other floated the Red Cross flag, made up a
picture as inviting as the usual aspect of a hospital-encampment
is the reverse.
Besides the tents devoted to the reception of wounded soldiers,
the round tent, in the centre of the plot, appropriated to the
use of wounded officers, the kitchen, store-house, washhouse, &c.,
there were the large and handsome tent-barracks, set apart for
the offices of the surgeon, the committee, the aids-volunteer, and
the ladies who lent their valuable aid to the common cause.
An ingenious system of drainage, and a cheap and simple, but
extremely efficacious system of heating, by which every tent was
constantly supplied with a current of fresh warm air, had secured
the most excellent sanitary conditions for all the habitations of
the ambulance.
Another marked feature of the establishment so beautifully
located, and so well provided with the most essential elements
of sanitary success, was the gratuitous character of the services
rendered by nearly the whole of its personnel.
When the Committee originally decided to establish a field
hospital, an essential part of its plan had been the formation of a
volunteer transport corps, not simply as an adjunct to the hos-
pital, but as an independent organization for general field service.
Ten or twelve ambulance waggons, a large number of stretchers,
and all the material necessary for the transport and care of the
wounded en route, had been especially prepared with reference to
this object.
<pb>
Several young Americans, resident or sojourning in Paris,
having expressed to the committee their desire to take part in
the labours of the ambulance, the offer had been most gladly
accepted; and these young gentlemen, to the number of nearly
thirty, were formed into two "volunteer squads," each having its
own captain—one being headed by Mr. Joseph K. Riggs, the other
by Mr. William B. Bowles. The two squads divided between them
the work of taking out the ambulance-waggons, collecting and
bringing back the wounded, distributing provisions, &c.—in a
word, all those duties which are usually discharged by an ambu-
lance corps. Each squad was on duty every other day, assembling
in the volunteers' headquarters at 8 a.m., and remaining on duty
until 6 p. m., ready to turn out on receipt of a note to that effect,
and being, in fact, almost constantly employed. But though the
two squads thus alternated their discharge of the duties assumed
by the corps, the whole body of the members generally assembled
there each day; and, as the restaurants in the neighbourhood
were nearly all closed, and they had come to feel quite at home
in their tent-barrack, they usually breakfasted at the ambulance,
paying for their repasts. Composed entirely of young men of
property and standing, this corps of aids-volunteer not only
added a new and invaluable element of strength to the personnel
of the ambulance, but served as a sort of connecting-wire be-
tween it and the whole of the American colony in Paris.
It has been already stated that several ladies gave their
zealous help and co-operation to the ambulance throughout its
entire duration. . Eighteen ladies gave their valuable services to
the ambulance, and of these some eight or nine were always there.
Some few of them became so much interested in the undertaking
that they took up their abode in the quarters appropriated to
them. It is needless to say that they nearly all proved to be
excellent nurses; and that the linen, the cooking, and other
branches of the hospital arrangements (no small matter where the
wants of a daily average of a hundred persons had to be provided
for during a period of several months), were admirably managed
under their active superintendence.
With the exception, therefore, of a corps of thirty-one paid
servants (twenty-seven men and four women), whom it had been
<pb>
necessary to engage for the discharge of the most distinctly menial
offices, and of one or two persons of higher social position—but
compelled, by their want of means, to accept a small payment from
the Committee—the entire work of the ambulance was done as a
labour of love, and with all the zeal and devotion, that are only
called out by the action of motives superior to considerations of
pecuniary gain. But, even in the case of those who received
ostensible wages, the modest amount of the latter was so utterly
disproportioned to the amount and quality of the services ren-
dered by them, that they, too, may justly share the praise of
having acted from those higher motives.
In order to render the attendance of the aids-volunteer as little
wearisome to themselves as was compatible with the nature of
the arduous duties they had taken upon themselves, the Com-
mittee placed a fine roomy tent-barrack at the disposal of the
corps; a second tent being appropriated, in like manner, to the
use of Mrs. Conklin and the other ladies who took part in the
work of the ambulance. Both these tents were comfortably and
handsomely fitted up with furniture, lent for that purpose by
their respective occupants, and were declared, by common con-
sent, to be a very satisfactory species of "headquarters." The
salon of the aids-volunteer was particularly well furnished; its
walls being hung with pictures and mirrors, and its ample dimen-
sions being well provided not only with chairs, lounges, tables,
&c., but with books and newspapers, with chess, and other means
of amusement, including a piano. The encampment possessed,
moreover, several singing-birds which were the pets of its entire
personnel, a tortoise-shell cat, and a yellow dog—which, having
had the remarkable fortune of having been born at the ambu-
lance, always held a high place in the general favour—as also,
four cows, and several horses—lent for the service of its waggons
by friends of the enterprise; a number of whom also used to send
their carriages out with the procession of its ambulance-waggons,
to assist in picking up, and bringing in, the wounded left out-
side the walls, after the desultory but almost continuous fighting
that went on round the city. The theatres and all other places of
public amusement were closed; the "Washington Club" was
shut up; the parlours of the American bankers, usually places of
<pb>
rendezvous for their countrymen in Paris, were entirely deserted;
and everything like visiting and social enjoyment had come to an
end through the painful pre-occupations of the siege. Under these
circumstances the ambulance of the Avenue dc 1'Imperatrice (or,
of the "Avenue d'Uhrich," as the broad and beautiful approach
to the Bois de Boulogne was then called, in honour of the
defender of Strasbourg), naturally became an important social
centre, not only for the Americans cooped up within "the circle
of iron and fire," but for many foreign residents, who constantly
dropped in to relieve the tedium of the time by a visit to the
quarters of the aids-volunteer, where something interesting Avas
always to be seen or heard; where the latest news was sure to
be promptly known, and the latest rumour to have found an
echo; and where the adventures of the "squad " of the previous
day—recounted by the heroes of each stirring tale, while the
alternate "squad" was taking its turn of adventurous duty
outside the walls—afforded an unfailing supply of excitement, in
the shape of narrative, description, incident, comment, inference,
or surmise. The piano, also, was in frequent request; and, as
several of the aids-volunteer were good singers, familiar strains,
lively or pathetic, as the case might be, were frequently indulged
in, by the squad not on duty; and, occasionally, when things
were quiet in the town, and in the military zone outside it, the
two divisions of the corps united their forces, and gave musical
parties in their tent, performing duets, glees, choruses, &c.,
greatly to the satisfaction of the performers, and affording as
beneficial an amusement to the wounded in the ambulance-tents,
as to the guests assembled in their hospitable quarters.
For several weeks the American minister, Mr. Washburne,
was a daily visitor at the ambulance; the consul-general for the
United States, General Reed, used frequently to come in;
General Burnside, General Sheridan, and nearly all the Ameri-
cans admitted into the city during the siege by special passes, or
who entered shortly after the surrender, also made it a point to
show their sympathy with the undertaking of their countrymen
by friendly visits. The ambulance was also visited by General
Trochu and his staff, General Thomas and his staff, by the Arch-
bishop of Paris, and many other French and foreign notabilities,
<pb>
military and civilian; while General Ducrot and Admiral Duquilo,
the commandant of the 5th military secteur in which the ambu-
lance was situated, were almost daily visitors.
Many Catholic priests were constant in their attendance on
the wounded of their church, who, of course, were in the majority;
a few Protestants were visited by a minister of their own faith.
All the wounded, without exception, were, however, attended
with equal kindness and devotion by the ladies of the ambulance,
who read to them, wrote letters for them, which took their chance
of getting out in the mail bags sent off in the postal-balloons—
and sometimes relieved the monotony of convalescence by playing
a game of draughts or backgammon with those who were well
enough to be amused by such pastimes.
One of the most widely known and most eminently popular of
the "properties " of the American ambulance was its peripatetic
"coffee-waggon," an ingenious arrangement of enormous coffee-
pots, and other reservoirs for tea and soup, with receptacles for
sugar and for crockery, and three large boilers for heating water.
The whole was set upon wheels and was drawn by two horses; it
was provided with a seat for the driver and distributors, and with
a fire-place so judiciously contrived beneath the boilers, that the
fire, kept alight by the current of air created by the motion of the
"establishment," brought the water to the boiling point, by the
time the vehicle reached its destination ; when the coffee and tea
being placed in their respective receptacles, the welcome brew
was ready, in the course of a very few minutes, for distribution
among the multitude of eager applicants that never failed to
gather around it on its passage.
This "coffee-waggon," the especial pride of the American
ambulance, had been constructed by Messrs. Dunton, of Phila-
delphia, for the "United States Christian Commission"-—an
organization, set on foot during the war of the Rebellion, for the
purpose of administering religious admonitions, consolations, and
publications, to the soldiers of the Federal army, but which, find-
ing its special ministrations to be at a rather considerable dis-
count among the latter, was fain to supplement these with gifts
of creature-comforts, and, having found that warmth was the
quality most feelingly appreciated by the recipients of the latter,
<pb>
devoted its benevolent energies, with the aid of this ingenious
contrivance, to the work of distributing the hot drinks of tea and
coffee, and the basins of steaming soup, that won for it the
hearty gratitude of so many thousands of cold and weary
soldiers. The waggon in question, had ended its original career
of usefulness at the Battle of Appomatox Court-house, the final
struggle in which the surrender of General Lee brought the
great conflict to a close.
On the conclusion of the war, the "coffee-waggon " was broken
up, and its various constituent portions were sold to different
parties. When Dr. Crane was travelling through the United
States in search of the various objects which formed a part of the
"sanitary collection" of the Paris Exhibition, he heard of the
famous " coffee-waggon," its patriotic and humanitarian exploits,
and the ignominious conclusion of its brilliant career, and forth-
with determined to hunt up its scattered members, and to per-
form, in regard to them, the feat of "putting together again,"
which, in regard to the "Humpty-Dumpty" of the nursery-
rhyme, "all the king's horses and all the king's men" are said
to have failed to accomplish. Fired with this bold resolve, that
gentleman set off to a factory in the interior of Pennsylvania,
where he had learned that the boilers of the " coffee-waggon"
were doing duty in the manufacture of soap; traced the fore-
wheels to a village in New Jersey, the hind wheels to another
point, the coffee-pots to a third, the fire-place to a fourth, and so
on, gradually picking up the disjecta membra of the useful public
functionary whose services, he felt, should have ensured for it a
more honourable treatment. Having thus succeeded in recover-
ing the various portions of the " coffee-waggon," with the excep-
tion of one or two small pieces that could not be found, he
put the whole into the hands of a clever carriage-builder of
Philadelphia, who supplied the lacking bits, and restored the
whole concern to its primitive state of serviceable completeness.
The resuscitated coffee-waggon, having figured with all due
honour in the Paris Exhibition, was destined to render admi-
rable service during the siege of the great capital; it accompanied
the ambulance waggons when taken out on their sad errand .
among the victims of the battle-field, and distributed its welcome
<pb>
largesses among the shivering crowds that hailed its appearance
with demonstrations of satisfaction whose sincerity could not be
a matter of doubt. By a singular coincidence, in keeping with
the rest of its career, the "coffee waggon" was taken out by a
party of the aids volunteer, to distribute its comforting beve-
rages at the battle of Montretout, which wound up the last of the
ill-omened sorties from Paris, and induced the surrender of the
capital. As at the battle which concluded the American war, so
at this concluding act of the sanguinary drama of the Franco-
German campaign, the "coffee-waggon" worked bravely all
through the fight; and it had the honour of numbering Baron
Larrey, surgeon-in-chief to the French army, among those to
whom it furnished coffee on that eventful day, and of calling
forth from him enthusiastic expressions of admiration and appro-
bation. And as though to complete the parallel in both cases,
this vehicle, which had once more escaped the dangers of the
conflict, was doomed to be again broken to pieces after it was
over. It is not unlikely its strange and sinister appearance, its
black smoke stacks, from which, from time to time, rolled out a
still blacker smoke—may have caused it to have been taken for
some monstrous engine of destruction, which was "firing up"
for its deadly work. However this may have been, as the
waggon was most pacifically standing at the close of the day in
the neighbourhood of the little village of Rueil, a German
battery suddenly opened upon it, and with such success, as to
explode a second or third shot immediately under the waggon.
Whereupon the terrified horses started off at a gallop, and
tearing back into Paris, dashed it to pieces on the way; when
they reached the ambulance, only the fore-part of the waggon
was left. All the rest of the mechanism had been broken up,
and had disappeared. But Dr. Crane having declared his fixed
determination to regain possession of the pieces, a detachment of
aids-volunteer set out at once to look for them, and succeeded
in finding them, scattered in different places along the road,
punctured with shot, and twisted and bent up, but, singular as
it may appear, none were missing.
The various parts of the vehicle, thus again collected together,
were put once more into the hands of a skilful carriage-builder,
<pb>
and in forty-eight hours the coffee-waggon was brought back to
the ambulance, so thoroughly repaired and rejuvenated, that it is
now in better and stronger condition than ever, and ready for
another campaign should the scourge of war be again let loose
in Europe.
Desirous of rendering as much service as possible to the
French wounded in the midst of the disasters of the time, the
Committee had increased the capacity of its hospital to 100 beds.
Some of the neighbouring landowners had also placed their
villas at the disposal of the ambulance, for the reception of the
wounded. It was thus able to receive a total of 150 patients,
who were treated with an average of success that rendered abun-
dantly evident the superiority of the system pursued, and, in the
opinion of the most competent judges, settled the question of the
relative merits of tents and of solid buildings, as receptacles of
the wounded, decisively in favour of the former. Dr. Swin-
burne's highly successful exemplification of the beneficial action of
conservative surgery, and of the re-formation of bone, excited
the greatest interest among the medical men who visited the
ambulance, in which oakum was employed in preference to lint,
on account of its antiseptic qualities, and compresses of hot and
cold water were mainly employed for dressings, to the exclusion
of many of the usual applications. Of seven cases of amputa-
tion of the thigh, only four resulted in death ; while at the ambu-
lance established in the Grand Hotel—with deficient ventila-
tion, with carpets and hangings that absorb the impurities of the
atmosphere, and thus generate gangrene—nearly every case of
amputation terminated fatally, just as is always the case in one
deadly ward of the great hospital of the H6tel Dieu (the largest
and oldest in Paris) where scarcely a patient amputated has ever
yet escaped death from gangrene or pysemia.
At the ambulance of the Grand Hotel the deaths have been
said to have exceeded 45 per cent. of the number of cases
treated. However this may be, the administration up to the
present time has declined to make public its record. Now, in the
far more economically conducted American ambulance, the pro-
portion of deaths, before the engagement of Bourget, was
only 3'33 per cent. After that date, fuel and provisions growing
<pb>
short, and cold and hunger killing many of those whose wounds
were healed or healing, the death-rate in the ambulance rose to
an average of 19 per cent. But even this greatly increased
mortality, due to circumstances beyond the control of the ambu-
lance, and altogether independent of its system of medical and
surgical treatment, still gave a result immensely in favour of the
latter, when compared with the proportion of deaths and cures
in nearly every other hospital of Paris. A comparison of the
results obtained in the American ambulance with those obtained
in all the other ambulances of the capital shows, therefore, that
the aim which its organizers had mainly in view in setting it on
foot, viz., that of demonstrating the superiority of tents over
solid buildings in the treatment of wounds, the immense impor-
tance of hygienic conditions as means of preventing disease and
facilitating cures, and the excellence of the surgical system
developed in the United States through the experiences of the
great American war, was completely attained. And lest he
may be thought to advance rather his own opinion, or the
opinion of those personally connected with the ambulance, the
writer will here present certain extracts from articles which ap-
peared from time to time in the Paris press, during the winter
of the siege; and he does this with all the more satisfaction, since
he is confident that while our pleasure and pride, as members
of the American ambulance, will not be lessened by "seeing our-
selves as others see us," he shall have also added to his narrative
a few pages which may increase its historical value, and which
may perhaps, at the same time, make better known to many of
our countrymen the character, relations, and general importance
of the ambulance and of our organization, when regarded simply
from an international point of view.
Shortly after the battle at Chevilly, the editor of the "Electeur
Libre," M. Picard, writes:—" Yesterday we visited the 'American
ambulance' . . is it necessary that we should dwell upon the
scrupulous cleanliness of this ambulance, on the assiduous care
with which our wounded are there treated. It is truly touching
to see foreigners of wealth thus giving themselves up without
reserve to this humane work. We have seen these gentlemen
assisting.the surgeons in their difficult work—holding the limbs
<pb>
of patients, engaged in all the details of dressing wounds, and
that, after having yesterday been even under the fire of the
enemy, to pick up these same wounded. These generous men
would be unwilling to have us give their names to the public;
all that we are able to say is, that their benevolent devotion
and their indefatigable ardour assure to them the gratitude of
France, whose friendship was long since gained by the States of
the American Union."1
In another journal published about the same time, we read:—
"A vast ambulance has been established by our American colony,
whom neither the prospective bombs of M. de Bismarck, nor
the dreary and desolate Grand Hotel, where the grass is
now growing between the flagstones of the court, nor the want
of butter and fresh eggs, nor that dire extremity—which we
are already beginning to touch with our finger-ends—ofbeing
reduced to eat horseflesh, instead of truffled partridges, have
driven from our walls. Never was a sacred work of sacred
humanity better conceived, or better put in practice, than by this
band of generous and devoted men, who, able to find security
everywhere else, for themselves, their families, and their fortunes,
have preferred to remain in our midst, to encourage us by their
presence, and with open hearts and open hands, to give us their
sympathy, their aid, and their succour—fraternal and so practical
—in the terrible crisis through which we are passing." 2
And we are told not only that the members of the ambulance
were at work in the wards of the hospital, but that they were no
less active in the field. "For the third time," says the Abbe
* * * "I went yesterday morning to Bourget, in the hope the
Prussians would give up to us more of our wounded. In fact,
the evening before, after having sent us a few, they said on dis-
missing us, 'Come back to-morrow, and we will give you the
rest!' Upon the Flanders road, deserted and gloomy, obstructed
at every step by trees which lay in the way, we met the Ameri-
can ambulance, always at the very front (au premier poste), when-
ever it was a question of comforting courage in misfortune. I
stopped to salute it," &c.3

<pb>
It was about this time also that the ambulance was the subject
of a notice, which, although it cannot here be easily reproduced,
is nevertheless quite worthy of being mentioned, as it brought to
the eye of many readers the character of the installation, and
several of its distinctive features in a way more effective, perhaps,
than could have been done by words. We refer to the large
woodcut engraving of the ambulance which appeared in the
"Illustration," of October 22nd, 1870.
We soon, however, began to hear it admitted not only that the
Americans were labouring most earnestly in a humane cause, but
that unusual successes were rewarding their efforts. "The Ameri-
can ambulance, established in the Avenue Uhrich, is one of those
which up to the present time has given the best results in the
curing of wounds. After the combat at Chevilly, Dr. Swin-
burne and his assistants obtained from the Prussians the restitu-
tion of a number of wounded French, all severely wounded, and
their care has saved them all."1
The attention of the Government was now particularly
directed to the ambulance, and it became the object of nume-
rous official visits ; among these was one made by the Military
Governor of Paris. His opinion has been recorded as follows:—
"Last Sunday General Trochu visited the American ambulance,
and expressed his complete satisfaction with the admirable in-
stallation of the different services as well as with the care taken
of the wounded."2
About a fortnight later, "On Monday, the 21st of November,
the Archbishop of Paris3 visited the ambulance, called American,
because it was established by a society of Americans who have
offered their services to France. In the tents we have a sample
of an ingenious disposition shown at the Exposition Universelle;
under these sails gracefully stretched out, so well aerated, so well
warmed, our soldiers receive those cares for which we should show
our gratitude. The skilful surgeon who performs the operations,

<pb>
and all those who aid him, bring as much of heart as of
science to this generous work, to which their sympathy for our
country has inspired them. . . . The archbishop expressed his
sincere thanks to the personnel of the ambulance, which he left
after having blessed all the tents." 1
So much general interest now began to be awakened by the
establishment on the Avenue de l'Imperatrice, that the journals
gave up whole columns to descriptions of the ambulance, its
pavilions, its organization, different services, &c.
In one of these descriptions, the writer says:—" The great
American Republic was the first to recognize and salute her
young sister—La Republique Francaise. If the doctrine of non-
intervention in European affairs, which has been accepted as a
principle by the statesmen of the New World, has not permitted
the sending out of an army of succour to violently break the
neutrality, proof is being offered at this very moment by acts
that the sympathy of one people for the other is not affirmed
solely by protestations and good wishes. Near the Bois de
Boulogne, nobly mutilated, upon the right hand of that avenue
which we used to call the Avenue de l'lmperatrice, I do not know
what they call it to-day, may be seen the 'Stars and Stripes'
of the American Union. This pavilion floats over the entrance of
the enclosure in which stands the American ambulance.
"During the long and rude trials which the terrible war of
secession imposed upon them, the Americans had both the time
and the occasion to study the most efficacious methods of taking
care of the victims of battle-fields. It is the bloody fruit of their
experience which they bring to us. Their ambulance may also
be said to be a model of its kind. Setting out with the principle
that hospital wards where the sick are commonly heaped
together, are, to use the expression of Cabanis, magazines of
corrupt air, the Americans have lodged our wounded under
tents grouped together in picturesque disorder, yet separate
one from the other .... The whole medical apparatus is
carefully concealed, it only appears when indispensable. There
are no herb teas, these are replaced by wine ; the drugs are

<pb>
purchased of the butcher, and the apothecaries are left to
advertise.
"The ladies of high social position, who serve as nurses, give
to these tents the appearance of drawing-rooms, they possess an
amiable charity, and double by their grace the value of their
services. They read to the sick, tell them stories, and do not
refuse, in case of need, to play with them a simple game of icarte.
If our wounded generals were not thirsting for revenge, there
are some of them, I am sure, who would fear lest they might be
cured too soon ....
"We have visited with grateful emotion the American ambu-
lance, and we rejoice, even in the midst of our sadness, to see
the knitting of those bonds, already so strong, which unite two
great peoples. Let the benignant smile of peace fall upon us,
and of this frightful catastrophe we will only preserve the re-
membrance of the generous sympathies of those who showed
themselves to be our friends in spite of all. It is the quarum
meminisse juvabit of the poet, an expression profound—alike sad
and consoling." 1
A few days later, a remarkable editorial article, entitled
"A Visit to the American Ambulance," appeared in the
"Official Journal " of the French Republic. This article, which
nearly filled the journal, extending as it did over two whole
broadsides, entered into many descriptive details, which it is
unnecessary to repeat here; its character and sentiment, however,
will appear in the following extracts. "Do you remember—so
thoroughly has all Paris forgotten the way—do you remember
that broad long avenue, to-day without a name, which from the
Arc of Triumph leads to the entrance of the Bois, as we still lately
said? It is there, upon that splendid and frivolous highway, a
sort of neutral ground for the world of fashion, that as evening
came on so many carriages used to pass, bearing—some towards
the lake, and some towards the Champs Elysees—all those
magnates, and all those parvenus, magnates by inheritance or
through their own personal successes, parvenus by the politics of
December, or by schemes of finance, interlope, or other. On

the horizon, on the summit of a green hill, rose a large white
mass, like one of those constructions which our Poussin loved to
throw into the background of his landscapes ; the silhouette was
beautiful to look upon when flooded with the golden mist of
sunset; it still is—it will always be. The white mass is the
noble fortress of Mont Valerien; and should you perchance go
towards the Bois, where to-day are encamped so many brave
and resolute troops, it is not unlikely you may hear the for-
midable reverberations which come from that now unwooded
hill. . . .
"In one of the largest villas, on the left of the great highway to
the Bois, is the military hospital of Ducrot's corps, skilfully and
intelligently directed by Dr. Sarrazin. Exactly opposite, on the
other side of the avenue, you observe some tents and flag-staffs.
'What's that singular encampment ?' you inquire, or perhaps even
you ask in a careless way, 'What's that ?'—indifferent, before
you see the red-cross flag. 'That? That is the American ambu-
lance, let us go in, and take my word for it, we shall have there
many things to see as well as to learn. . . . When we first made
this eminently profitable pilgrimage, by a chance fortunate for
us, it was at the very time General Trochu was himself visiting
the ambulance, distributing well-merited felicitations to those
heroes who have been wounded before Paris, and putting one
down for the military medal, and another for the ' Cross.' The day
was declining; the attendants were passing holding in their hands
the spherical lanterns, which they were about to hang up in the
tents; and when, not having yet gone within them, we perceived
without, the light shining through the walls of simple canvas,
upon which were sketched even the profiles of the beds on which the
wounded were lying, we were unable to refrain from exclaiming
'How is it possible to keep within these constructions a suitable
and uniform temperature?' A Frenchman—let us confess it, in
a whisper and entre nous—a Frenchman could scarcely be a
Frenchman, if he did not begin to doubt a little about the
excellence of what he has not seen. We are all of us born with
a critical sense extremely developed, and we are very fortunate, if
it is not with a fixed determination to admire nothing which is
not made at home. However low we may have pronounced these
E
<pb>
words, perhaps our guide may have overheard them; be this as it
may, we were simply invited to ' Come in.'
"The day was sombre, cold and damp, nevertheless, the moment
we had entered, we found that we were breathing an atmosphere
pure but not dry, and at the same time comfortably warm. The
temperature was uniform throughout the whole length of the
pavilion, ranging from 15° to 18° (centigrade.)
"The atmosphere was healthful, as we have already said—and
that is easily to be understood, renewed as it constantly is by
an ingenious system of heating, and doubtless also by its easy
passage through the thin walls ; thin—we admit it, but which only
let the air escape which has been utilized in respiration, or rendered
impure by vitiated emanations from a thousand causes readily
understood, without permitting, the least in the world, that
without to enter except by the ways desired and beforehand
prepared. In fact, nothing could be simpler, or altogether more
ingenious than the system of heating and of ventilation employed
here, for it is the system of heating which secures the ventilation."
Here follows a long and very clear account of the system of
heating and ventilating employed, after which the writer thus con-
tinues :—" Is it now understood how it is brought about that one
may breathe under the tents only an air warm and healthful;
and is there occasion for being astonished that, as a consequence,
where the American system is applied, everybody should be
absolutely ignorant, or as much as it is necessary to be, not only
of what purulent absorption (scientifically called pycemia) and
hospital gangrene may be, but even of the fever, which is not a
necessary consequence of a wound? In truth, none but those
who have been really wounded are admitted to the tents; no
sick are received there, and this in the common interest of both.
.... We have dwelt at length upon that single point aeration,
and we do not regret it ... . yes, this secured, the air con-
stantly revivified and maintained at a temperature always
uniform (we do not pretend to say that in France we have not
sometimes obtained this desirable result by other and less simple
means), this point secured, it was for us an assured guarantee
that the rest of the American system was conceived in the
same eminently practical spirit. Our anticipations have not
<pb>
been disappointed. Go there, if you will, in doubt, you shall leave
with faith!
"To understand it all, you should go out with the ambulance
waggons, pick up one of our wounded in the field, and sympa-
thetically follow him day by day until, convalescent, he is
sent to the branch establishment on the other side of the avenue.
But how can we describe in all their details, which we ought
perhaps to do, these ambulance waggons, so light, so comfortable, so
simple, and so perfectly suspended that the jolts of the road are
scarcely felt by the wounded? Whatever our desire to do this,
it may suffice in this place to say, that each one of these waggons
can carry anywhere in the field four men seriously wounded,
and consequently lying down ; that these men can be placed in the
waggons without change from the stretchers and leather-cushioned
scats, which become stretchers in the twinkling of an eye, by
pulling out handles encased in telescopic slides at the four corners.
The seats or mattresses are furnished with wheels, which, when
the mattresses are open upon the floor of the waggon, rest on
strong and flexible springs. The stretchers above are sustained
by leathern thongs. The air circulates freely within the waggons,
and finally there is a water tank in the side of each to provide a
supply of water, that supreme demand at certain moments, and
the indispensable auxiliary of the first dressings. . . .
"Every morning Dr. Swinburne, a gentleman as modest as he
is well informed, accompanied by his aids, attends to the dressing
of the wounded. Formerly Port physician of the city of New
York, he was travelling in Europe when the war broke out;
his devotion has kept him here, to assume the noble task which
he is fulfilling with such admirable zeal. . . . Aid nature, instead
of affronting her, such is their device, and such is henceforth, we
know, that also of our greatest French practitioners; it is for ever
the admirable and simple expression of our own Ambroise Pare\
'I dress his wounds—God cures him!'
f< Our helpful Americans do not make use of the common lint—
that lint which so many charitable fingers here among us
laboured painfully to prepare—theirs is made of a sort of tow,
obtained from old ropes coarsely picked, the tar with which
it is impregnated playing an important antiseptic role in the
course of the cure.
<pb>
"We hardly need to add, after all this, that at the American
ambulance every one is a declared partizan of conservative
surgery — that delicate art which is, happily, also in honour
among us. . .
"And now a word about those who extend these unremitting
attentions to our wounded, who generously offer them these
effective consolations, shall they find us indifferent? No. How-
could we fail to recognize that which they are doing for us, if it
was only by showing how singularly practical are the ideas of
those excellent surgeons, who have come from the other side of
the Atlantic to place at our service, with so much generosity,
their incontestable science and their indefatigable devotion?
How could we forget to thank them for their sacrifices and their
humanity, those Americans of Paris, who have borne among them-
selves all the expense of this hospital establishment? How
could we fail to find a word of grateful acknowledgment for
those ladies of the American colony, who have remained in our
invested capital, when they come to seat themselves by the
pillows of our wounded, on whom they wait with all the
affectionate grace which a sister could show a brother? Do we
not know them all by name, these noble voluntary nurses, from
whom we have so many times seen, and never in vain, our brave
boys asking help with filial deference? We shall be excused for
having passed over in silence many technical details to which
we might have usefully referred, but we should not have accom-
plished, even now, half our task had we stopped, only to enume-
rate, the new curative expedients—perhaps still unemployed in
France—in a word, the innovations of every sort for which
hospital science is indebted to the Americans, who themselves
were taught by that long and cruel war in the course of which
Lincoln fell by the assassin's hand, and Grant became so
illustrious." 1
In another journal we read:—" Among all these ambulances,
whether old or new, which exist at Paris, there is one distin-
1 "Journal Officiel de la Rcpublique Francaise," November 27, 1870. The
whole article was republished in the "Gazette des Hopitaux," January 26, 1871.
under the title of " Documents pour servir a l'Histoire du Mouvement Scientifique
pendant le Siege do Paris."
<pb>
guished by its organization, and particularly by its system of in-
stallation, the American ambulance, No. 36, Avenue Uhrich. A
rich and sumptuous residence was not selected for the establish-
ment of this ambulance, but simply a large unoccupied plot of
ground, now marked in the distance by two enormous flag-staffs,
one of which supports the Geneva flag, the other the American
national colours. Here, since the beginning of the war, a little
colony of assistance and benevolence has been at work, which
owes its origin to Dr. Thomas W. Evans, who, while in England
preparing many things necessary for the completion of this ambu-
lance, wholly American, was prevented from returning to Paris
by the investment of the city. . .
"The grounds have been agreeably improved, by the setting out
of a great number of pines, which have been brought in from the
Bois de Boulogne. It is amongst this shrubbery that the tents
have been pitched, and it is under these tents that every comfort
for the care of the sick has been collected. . . A visit to the
ambulance waggons is worthy of a special mention, by reason
of the comfort with which the wounded are carried in them. The
"Societe de Secours aux Blesses" has, in fact, recognized and
adopted the different ameliorations of this service. There is no
occasion for us to render homage to the devotion of the persons
attached to this ambulance, nor to the united efforts of the
American colony which contributes to its support. The attentions
which our wounded receive there are the best testimony to this
fact. In front of the ambulance is a large house which serves
as a convalescent establishment, for those who have been cured,
and they are many." 1
Another journal of nearly the same date observes :—" It is
but just to acknowledge how nobly the citizens of the United
States have recognized and returned, during this war, the
fraternal hospitalities which we have extended to them in times
of peace. Neither the minister, Mr. Washburne, nor the First
Secretary, Mr. Hoffmann, has left the American legation ; and
this is saying not a little when, as is known, there is in Paris
1 "Le National," December 11, 1870; and republished in the "Gazette des
Hopitaux," March 21,1871.
<pb>
with the exception of the honourable gentleman whom I have
just named but one other foreign minister—M. Kern, of the Swiss
Confederation. This, however, does not express the extent of the
earnest goodwill of the Americans towards us; they have also
established an ambulance for our wounded, and the curious con-
struction of their improvised hospital brings to mind those which
they so happily devised during the War of Secession. . . Every-
thing is in the most perfect order, and the cleanliness is most
exemplary. Here ladies take care of the wounded—ladies of
society—and they tend our wounded with that earnest solicitude,
that watchful and maternal attention, of which woman—in every
country, in every climate—alone has the secret. These precious
cares will contribute not a little to the healing of our brave
soldiers. Among these American ladies who are taking care of
our wounded, I have seen more than one still young and pretty
—that which can do no harm, and may even singularly assist
the cure.
"All are delighted thus to recognize the hospitality, which
France has ahvays so generously exhibited to all the world, and
especially, in these later years, to the American people, who, it
may be said, have made of Paris their veritable capital. As I
was leaving the ground with emotion, after all I bad seen,
'We owe you all this,' said one of the ladies to me; 'we are
trying to pay off a part of the debt contracted by America with
France in the time of Lafayette, and at the same time we wish to
return something of the gracious hospitality which Ave have
always found in Paris."1
M. Gustave Lafarge thus writes about "L'Ambulance Ameri-
caine" :—" About half way down the Avenue de l'lmperatrice, on
the right, you perceive a number of tents, not a large number—a
veritable little city of canvas—it is the American ambulance.
You are at first surprised that the wounded can be treated
almost in the open air, but if you enter you will very quickly
change your first impression. It was in the United States,
during the Secession War, that tent-hospitals, or open-air ambu-
lances, were for the first time used on a large scale. There
1 "La Liberte," December, 1870.
<pb>
awere not in that country, as in Europe, vast and ancient edifices,
convents and churches—everything had to be created; and the
portable tent—la tente volante—established in the rear of armies
constantly in movement, played a very important role. It offered
the double advantage of securing immediate care for the
wounded, and of leaving these wounded, who are young and
vigorous, in the same conditions as they were in previously—that
is to say, in the free air, instead of heaping them together in close
and badly-ventilated quarters. Let no one fear that bronchitis and
other diseases of the respiratory organs have been occasioned by
this practice. Facts have settled this question. Fresh air has,
moreover, the effect of increasing the appetite; and in this
way, consequently, has also contributed to re-establish the
strength of the sick.
"The most exact statistics have confirmed what European
science has been affirming, under every form, since the war in
the Crimea. Dr. Evans liberally placed at the disposal of
the American ambulance all the matiriel exhibited by him,
in 1867, in the section of the International Society; and
through his efforts the ambulance of the Avenue de lTmpera-
trice was thoroughly organized. His fellow-countrymen, imitat-
ing his zeal, have outdone one another in generously consecrating
their time and their labour to the relief of our wounded. Let
our warmest thanks be given to all those generous foreigners
who, in these times of trial, forget their nationality to listen only
to the voice of the heart, to the cry of humanity."
After having described the tents, the heating apparatus, &c.,
M. Lafarge sums up the advantages secured by these arrange-
ments as follows:—
"1st. The service of the etablishmsent is carried on outside of
the tents.
"2nd. All the heat of the stove—even that of the smoke, which
is considerable—is utilized.
"3rd. One can at will, by means of the simplest registers—of
sheet-iron, oil-cloth, and boards—regulate the temperature in all
parts of the tent.
"4th. The temperature of the ground is equal to, if not above,
that of the floor—it is constant, healthy, and free from humidity;
<pb>
the ventilation is perfect; the air is regularly displaced in every
part of the tent.
"In the very coldest weather, a sufficient temperature can be
maintained inside of these American tents. During the severe
weather of December, when the cold was 10° or 12° below zero
(centigrade), the temperature was maintained within the tents
at from +12° to +15°, and that without forcing the fires.
"The waggons for the transport of the wounded are of the most
comfortable kind, and, by an ingenious system, can be rapidly
fitted with either seats or beds. Double interior springs prevent
the least shock.
"The American ambulance has been established by an Ameri-
can Committee, who have met all the expenses necessary to
maintain it ... .
"Go and visit the American ambulance; not only will you meet
there with the most gracious reception, but you will obtain from
the lips of the wounded themselves the expression of their lively
gratitude for the intelligent care they are receiving."1
As the ambulance became more and more an object of interest
to the public, so more and more frequent allusions were made to
the remarkably excellent surgical results obtained there.
"It is already possible, by comparing the results obtained, to
perceive the relative inferiority of certain of our great ambu-
lances, and of the infinitely preferable hygienic conditions of
certain others. But it has been absolutely demonstrated to-day,
to every one who does not shut his eyes to the evidence, that the
'constant renewal of the respirable air is the principal curative
agent in all those places where large numbers of wounded are
brought together. The good aeration of hospital shelter con-
cerns us more than anything else. A place where the air is
constantly renewed, with an indifferent surgeon, would appear
to us greatly preferable to an infected establishment, in which the
operations were performed by the most skilful practitioner of the
day. We are of those who, a truth once established, hasten to
the application of that truth. The day when, for example, it
1 "Le Figaro," 26 Janvier, 1871.
<pb>
had been proved that the system of tent ambulances was the
only one which rendered purulent absorption and hospital gan-
grene impossible, on that very day we should have established in
Paris, cost what it might, fifty or a hundred encampments after
the manner of that American ambulance, about which so much
has been said during the last three months, but which it would
have been much better to have simply imitated." 1
In the course of a review of a work written by M. Augustin
Cochin, entitled "Le Service de Sante des Armies, avant et
pendant le Siege de Paris," the reviewer observes:—" We shall
close with this word ' virtues,' since every one in France has ex-
hibited them in so far as the service of the wounded is concerned.
There is room, however, for thanking M. Cochin for his book,
which has accorded to each one the part which belongs to him in
this humanitarian work. He has taken care, as a conscientious
writer should, to obtain information about persons as well as
things. Thus he has not attributed, as a journal recently did,
the conception and the establishment of the American ambulance
a—that ambulance where the fewest wounded die—to any other than
its founder, Dr. Thomas W. Evans."2
It possibly may be said by some cynically inclined person:—
"But these are mere newspaper compliments, and everybody
knows as well how cheaply they are obtained, as how to appreciate
them." The writer of this History can only reply that, although
absent from Paris during the whole period in which the ambulance
was the subject of these friendly criticisms, he has every reason
to believe them, as well as the expressions of recognition already
cited, to have been the unsolicited and spontaneous utterances of
a people who, whatever their faults, possess a delicate and in-
stinctive sense of justice, which never suffers a service to pass
unrecognized, or a favour unrequited. No ; they are not merely
casual newspaper paragraphs. Every one acquainted with French
journalism knows that one of its peculiarities — one of its ex-
cellences it should be said—is that scientific subjects are rarely
alluded to, even in the most trifling way, except by scientific

a " La Patrie," Jan. 19, 1871.
<pb>
men. There is scarcely a newspaper which does not have
its scientific editor, who is responsible for everything which
appears in his department. Many of the finest contributions,
even to French general medical literature, have made their first
appearance in the columns of popular journals. But he will not
discuss further the value of these opinions. Fortunately, it is
needless for him to do so, as the same opinions have been expressed,
and by others whose sincerity, whose competence, and whose in-
ability tobe deceived by humbug, even though it come from America,
can scarcely be called in question—by the physicians and surgeons
of Paris, nearly the whole of whom—of those whose names are as
well known abroad as at home—have borne personal testimony
to the excellence of the system exhibited in the American
ambulance, and to the efficiency with which it was directed.
Larrey, Nelaton, Ricord, Gosselin, Verneuille, Daremburg; how
many names might we not recall! But we must let these gentle-
men speak for themselves, and, perhaps, such written testimony
offered by them as we now possess cannot better be introduced
than by some extracts from an article written for the "Temps"
by M. Francisque Sarcey, a well-known and distinguished,
French literary gentleman. If M. Sarcey writes, it will be
observed that Dr. * * * speaks, and we can assure the
reader that Dr. * * * is no literary fiction. Says M. Sarcey:—
"I met a few days since one of the thousand acquaintances
which every Parisian, a little known, has upon the Boulevard—
a physician by profession, distinguished, I might almost say cele-
brated, in a certain surgical specialty, and who like most of his
confreres, is attached to one of our numerous ambulances. The
conversation fell naturally upon the subject of ambulances. He
was full of it, and it happened also that I was a little acquainted
with it, being very intimate with one of those persons most
occupied with the direction of the ambulances of the Press. I
had also once studied with great care the remarkable work of Dr.
Chenu, with the intention of making, in my turn, and with his
facts, a campaign against the organization of the medical service
in our armies.
"' You are interested in this?' said he, 'very well; and you
have probably visited the American ambulance?' I con-
<pb>
fessed that I had not. 'Then I must take you there. Ah! my
friend, those people there are our masters. How simple, in-
genious, and practical, in everything connected with its organiza-
tion. It is made of nothing, as we should say. Their installation
has scarcely cost twenty thousand francs, and they have a
hospital the most healthful, the most convenient, and the best
furnished with all needful things—the model hospital—the
hospital of the future; and permit me—you can render a great
service, you journalists.' What service do you allude to? 'I
will tell you. Our most eminent physicians have visited this
ambulance. I have met there Nelaton, Ricord, Jules Guerin,
Demarquais, and others. They have pronounced it excellent;
but to get excited upon the subject, to burn resolutely the
false gods, to create a revolution in our whole system, I will
not say of ambulances, but of hospitals, this is a very different
matter. Every physician in Paris should go and see, and con-
vince himself with his own eyes of the superiority of the
American installation. The public should come to the rescue,
that administrative routine may be forced out of its absurd paths
by a vigorous and irresistible pressure of opinion. We have
long known these things by theory, and we have said them;
but to-day the facts are before us—evident, and flashing light
into the most prejudiced eyes. Profit by the opportunity, cry
out in the journals—in yours; for the medical gazettes are
only read by a profession which it is useless to convince. It
is through the ignorant and the humble, through the crowd,
that important reforms and great revolutions are effected.
Remark,' he added, 'what a distance there is between theory
and practice. You have occasionally had the pleasure of talking
with Dr. Chenu. You have read his great medical and statistical
work concerning the wars of Italy and the Crimea. You know
the conclusion to which he arrived, and which he has presented
with marvellous force. He has demonstrated, and by an infi-
nite number of invincible proofs, that every agglomeration of
wounded shut up in close and badly ventilated places was exposed
to hospital gangrene and death. He was the source in France of
that great movement of opinion which has condemned vast
sedentary hospitals. Very well; he is now at the head of an
<pb>
ambulance, and where is it established? In the very heart of
Paris, at the Grand Hotel! In rooms, which, on one side, only
receive their light from passage-ways, and on the other, from
a closed court covered with a glass roof. Observe that these
apartments are stuffed with curtains, which absorb and be-
come impregnated with miasms; that the passage ways are
covered with carpets, which perform a similar office; that the
air circulates badly, and is unrenewed, and yet air is the first of
our restoratives. What shall I tell you? I doubt if I ought to
give you the figures, for they are terrible. There have been
twenty amputations of the thigh at the Grand Hotel, and out
of these twenty cases there have been twenty deaths. We
cannot doubt the skill of our surgeons. I assure you, all false
modesty aside, that we operate as well, not to say better, than our
American neighbours. But the surrounding circumstances are
unfavourable. You cannot imagine—you people of the world—
the subtle influence of infection on open wounds. There is at
the Hotel Dieu a ward which faces the river, where hospital
gangrene is endemic. Never has an amputation succeeded there.'
Very well, said I, let them put the amputated somewhere else,
that is very simple. 'Very simple! I see you are still an
innocent, my dear fellow. Nothing is simple in administration
in our country. A sick man is brought in, there is an empty
bed. The sick man has a number, and so has the bed.
The sick man is put in the bed, and he dies ; but there is
nothing to be said, the number was in its place, good order is
preserved, and the register is correct. Everything is for the best
in the best of administrations. And what if I told you that the rent
of the Grand Hotel costs the ' Societe de Secours' 500 francs a
day,—500 francs ! when for 30,000 francs upon the Trocadero, or
in any one of our avenues, these gentlemen could have established
barracks, healthy, convenient, elegant even, as the Americans
have done!'
"He said to me many things besides, which I do not re-
peat, some because I do not remember them, and others be-
cause I remember them too well, and all truths are not to be
written out in a journal. The next morning, however, he took
me in his carriage to the Avenue de lTmperatrice, and to the
<pb>
American ambulance. I had invited one of my confreres to
accompany me, M. Armand Gouzien, who was the director of one
of the ambulances of the Press, and was much occupied with
their organization. I was very desirous that he should see
'with me these pretended marvels, and give me his opinion of
them.
"The interior appearance is charming, it is that of a camp in a
grove, the tents are pitched at intervals." After describing the
tents, barracks, heating apparatus, &c., the writer continues:—
"Nothing could be neater, more convenient, and I shall also say
more beautiful, than this installation. On entering, you do not
perceive that insipid sickening hospital odour, which occasions a
nausea among those little accustomed to these places. It is clear
that when dressings are being made, the gases which rise may be
disagreeable, and it may require a little practice to get over the
disgust which the spectacle occasions, but the odours escape
quickly, thanks to the abundant openings, and it is scarcely, if at
all, that they pass from one tent to the other. . . .
"We were received by the surgeon in chief, M. Swinburne . . .
and by M. M * * *, who speak our language with the greatest
purity, and who gave us answers to all our questions with the
most perfect courtesy; and it would be impossible to accuse them
of having had in view, by so doing, any publicity through the
press. My name, I confess it very humbly, seemed to suggest
nothing to them, and whatever special attentions were paid,
were offered, as was proper, to my two friends, who were of the
party. And they were in ecstasies over the admirable simplicity,
according to them, of certain methods of placing the person
in bed and of dressing wounds, which Gouzien declared he
would have tried for certain cases of fracture in the ambulances of
the Press. Not being learned in such matters, I must confess
that I only half appreciated the ingenuity of these inventions;
but that which struck me there was the evident fondness for
practical methods, in the solution of the most complicated pro-
blems of surgery—methods which were at the same time con-
venient and elegant. To do much with little, without trouble
and without expense, to employ that which is at hand, modify-
ing it ingeniously to suit the case presented—this is the ground-
<pb>
work of their system; no outlay for the apparatus, none for
setting it up—they have no other vanity than that of curing
their patients. . . .
"And here again my doctor spoke, 'When it was a question of
constructing the H6tel Dieu, the medical commission then con-
sulted did, in fact, write a report condemning the project. But
it was satisfied with this platonic and sterile protestation. We
all should have had the courage to say, we have no wish to be
the accomplices of the assassinations which are about to be perpe-
trated in that vast charnel house ; we shall, as a body, send in
our resignations. Perhaps the proposition would have been
withdrawn, and yet I am by no means certain of this; for in
France, and this is a truth which cannot be too often repeated,
hospitals are not constructed for the sick who die in them, but
for the officials who live on them.
"' Of all the Parisian hospitals, the best arranged, the one which
has been constructed with the greatest care according to all the
rules of science, is the hospital Laripoisiere, and the mortality
there is frightful. In other words, it is a great hospital. It is in
vain to ventilate, the miasms penetrate the floors, incrust the
walls, dance in the air which is breathed, and transform in a
twinkle an illness of little consequence into a mortal malady.
The Cochin hospital, on the other hand, was devilishly built;
but it is small; there are very few sick there, and they get
well. . . . The Americans have given the last blow to the
prejudice—the hospital as it exists in France, as routine has
constructed and maintains it, must be killed, and we shall reach
our end.'
"So spoke my friend, and with an eloquence of conviction which
I cannot render. Is he right in all respects? this I am unable to
affirm, but his ideas have appeared to me to be worth at least a
public presentation. A visit to the American ambulance will, I
have no doubt, prove useful to persons who are occupied with
these questions, and they are now many. Already the Direction
of the ambulances of the Press are about to establish on the Rue
de la Pompe, barracks constructed on the same system, and they
hope to derive from them excellent results. This deplorable war
will have had at least the advantage of introducing into practice
<pb>
those principles of hygiene already commended by most of our
great surgeons."1
Says Dr. Dusart:—" The approval with which my article in
the "Rappel" on the ambulance of the Champs Elysees has been
received, has convinced me that my opinion is one shared by the
immense majority of the medical profession. The role of the phy-
sician should not be limited to a criticism of established things;
he ought, above all, to seek out the means of doing better.
Acquainted therefore with the admirable results obtained by
American surgeons during their own late war, and wishing to
examine, de visu, the means employed to obtain them, I went
to the ambulance established by the American International
Sanitary Committee, in an open lot on the Avenue Uhrich—ex-
Avenue de l'lmperatrice. Very cordially received, I have been
able to see for myself all the details of the organization, concern-
ing which the gentlemen in charge were anxious to give me
every possible information, with a courtesy which I am here
extremely pleased to recognize.
This ambulance is composed of several long tents, in each one
of which are twenty or twenty-five beds, disposed in two lines,
and only separated from each other by a distance of about five
feet. At first one is inclined to fear lest such a number of
wounded, in so restricted a space, might produce a serious vitia-
tion of the atmosphere. One is therefore not a little surprised
on entering, to breathe an air absolutely pure, without any trace
of odour, and maintained at a mild and uniform temperature—
results which are scarcely obtained in the best kept wards of our
Paris hospitals, and which offer a striking contrast with the dis-
agreeable smells and frosty air of the wards in the Palais
d'Industrie. This is due to the free circulation of air obtained by
the construction of the tents and the system of heating.
"We may notice also the system of dressing wounds—oakum
and warm-water dressings, covered with oil silk. Under these
circumstances, we have in no wise been surprised, to find all the

wounded with fresh, rosy complexions and cheerful countenances
—signs of a well-being which all were earnest to announce. All
the men whom I questioned affirmed that the only fever they
had had occurred during the twenty-four hours immediately
following the fight The chief surgeon and his aids are
surrounded by their compatriots—rich for the most part—who,
under their direction, go on to the field of battle to pick up the
wounded (we know that their bearing and their zeal were much
remarked during the action of the 21st), and who accept within
the ambulance the humblest functions. The female nurses are
American ladies, who, in a simple, unaffected way, take the most
devoted care of our wounded, who acknowledge the same in
never-ending praises. . . . We will not finish without saying a
few words in regard to the means of transportation, and especially
of the waggon (Evans's), in which the stretchers are suspended by
means of leathern thongs. It can carry ten men slightly wounded,
or four men seriously wounded, who can lie down comfortably
and be lifted in and out upon their beds, without change or jolt-
ing. A water-tank under the seat supplies water, either for
drinking or for use in the first dressings. The ambulance thus
organized is capable of receiving one hundred patients, and yet
all this material—tents, pharmacy, offices, &c.—cost only the
extremely small sum of 25,000 francs. Let a comparison be
made between these figures and those of the "Societe de Secours
aux Blesses," and especially let the results on both sides be com-
pared, and it will be seen that, upon the matter of hospitalization,
as well as in many other subjects, this people, so essentially
practical, has the very best title to be considered as our model.
"France will owe to the intelligent and devoted efforts of the
American colony the privilege of seeing many of her soldiers
returning to the army after a short treatment, while many of the
wounded will have preserved their limbs, which anywhere else
would have certainly been cut off."1
As with the secular press, the praises of the medical journals
were by no means restricted to the organization and administra-

tion of the hospital on the Avenue de l'lmperatrice. The trans-
port corps, the "aids volunteer," and their prompt and efficient
services, were fully recognized. Represented at every battle or
important skirmish in front of Paris, we have been told by the
Abbe * * * how they were always first in the field; a medical
writer has told us how they were the last to leave it. It was at
the battle of Champigny; the corps had been out all day, having
left the ambulance before daybreak; twice had the waggons
returned loaded with wounded; the day was severely cold; the
men were greatly fatigued, and the horses perhaps still more so?
for it had been impossible to obtain a change. Just after sundown
a squad of volunteers left the ambulance on a third trip to the field.
The results of this trip are thus alluded to:—" The firing had
ceased. We were not the only ambulance corps on the ground.
The ambulance Chaptal, under the direction of M. de Pressense,
I think, and the American ambulance had there each their waggons
and a squad. We went forward with the chief and two stretcher
bearers of the American corps, one of whom, understanding
German, served as our interpreter. It was dark, but we had a
lantern and our flag, and we went on towards the Prussian out-
posts. . . . One of us cried out in French, 'Ambulance,' and
our interpreter repeated this in German, and the Prussians per-
mitted four of us to advance. The chief of the American squad
declined to give his titles, and presented us as French doctors.
We found a number of wounded. . . . The chief of the American
squad was alone permitted by the Prussian officers, to go on
farther. . . . He, however, soon returned, telling us he had
found fifteen or twenty more wounded . . . but all our waggons
were full, it was now ten o'clock, our stretcher-bearers were ex-
hausted, and we were forced to return," &c.1 But to complete
this incident, it may be said, that the "chief of the American
squad" did not return, until he had placed in his own waggons
several of the wounded whom he had found, and whom he con-
ducted safely to the ambulance late at night.
In an article in the same journal, the "Gazette MMicale de

Paris," Dr. de Rause, the editor, writes as follows:—"There is a
very general disposition in France to give credit to whatever may-
come to us from abroad. The American ambulance was there-
fore, from its very origin, destined to have a certain success. In
the 'Gazette MeMicale' we never yield to such considerations,
but we like to be just towards every one, and to point out the good
wherever we may chance to find it. We have visited the Ame-
rican ambulance twice." The writer here enters upon a descrip-
tion of the materiel of the ambulance, &c., and observes, en passant,
"American surgeons are accused generally of an over fondness
for operating, on the contrary, we have noted with pleasure the
efforts—efforts crowned with success—of their conservative sur-
gery. We have thus seen several cases of comminuted fracture of
the femur in the course of cure. . . . M. Swinburne is the only
surgeon at the ambulance (Dr. Johnson having the title and
acting as consulting physician). His aids are for the most part
gentlemen devoted to this charitable work, and who support it
alike with their services and their fortunes. The artists appear
to even rival the bankers, and we have seen one of the latter
dressing a man whose shoulder had been resected—one of our
internes could have done no better."
Dr. de Rause compares the results of his inspection of the
various ambulances of Paris, and unhesitatingly awards the palm
to the American tent-hospital in the Avenue de Uhrich. Having
shown the superiority of its arrangements in regard to ventila-
tion, temperature, and all the other details of its material installa-
tion, and emphatically affirmed the immense superiority of its
hygienic arrangements, and of the results of its " conservative sur-
gery," Dr. de Rause thus sums up his convictions on the subject:—
"A revolution in our system of hospital hygiene is therefore
necessary, imminent, and, we may add, already begun; witness
the tents just established in the Luxembourg Garden, the huts in
the Garden of Plants, and those which are about to be inaugu-
rated in the ambulances of the Press. Let us hope that this revolu-
tion will be complete, and that in a few years' time not a stone of
our present hospitals will be left standing, unless, indeed, those
buildings shall have been devoted to some other use."
The "Union M&Jicale" speaks of the ambulance as follows :—
<pb>
"Not far from the barrack-hospital at Passy, in the Avenue
TJhrich, formerly Avenue de l'lmperatrice, is the American tent-
hospital; we visited it recently." After having described the con-
struction and organization of the ambulance, the writer ob-
serves :—" We entered all the tents, where were assembled a
number of wounded relatively considerable, and we can assert
that we noticed no disagreeable odour. . . Such, in a word, with-
out entering into further details, is the American tent-ambulance.
We have mentioned it in connection with the barrack-hospital
near by to show our readers the differences in the two systems.
We shall be able later to appreciate by comparison the services
which each may have rendered. It was useful, it was desirable
that an experiment should be made on a large scale as to the
value of temporary constructions for the sick and wounded, as
compared with convents, old buildings, and ordinary hospitals.
It was necessary to abandon the old routine, and to test the
new system which had already been tried in the United States
during a four years' war, and whose advantages had been recog-
nized by all the surgeons of the country.
"Let us hope this new experiment will not be fruitless, and
that it may confirm the results already obtained. While the
genius of destruction multiplies its ravages and accumulates ruins,
it is a consolation to believe that the genius of conservation—
less powerful, alas—has been able at the same time to make a
step forward. We shall be happy if in the midst of this bloody
orgie of force we have been able to save a few lives more than
usual." 1

HISTORY OF THE
having observed that he reserves his remarks on the latter until
the last, "its special arrangements demanding a special study,"
thus sums up the results of his examination :—
"I have reserved for the last, as being the most important, the
American ambulance, for it has, in fact, appeared to me to
deserve an attention altogether special, in consequence of the
peculiar arrangements by which it is distinguished, arrange-
ments which deserve to be studied, especially by those who in
future would establish an ambulance.
"At the American Ambulance there are no houses, there are
not even boarded barracks, excepting for the offices, pharmacy,
kitchen, guard-room, &c.; there are only simple sail-cloth tents,
supported in the centre by wooden standards, and fixed outside
by ropes fastened to solid wooden stakes driven into the ground.
The covering of each tent is double; the inner one is furnished
with small square windows which can be raised outwards, and
which, when thus raised, push apart the two coverings of the
tent. The cloth {cotton-duck) of which these coverings are
composed, is impermeable, and not a drop of water can penetrate
it, even though it should remain for a long period exposed to
the rain; but this impermeability to moisture does not prevent
the air and the light from entering, and the tent is lighted only
in this way. The air, passing through the entire covering of
the tent, and not as in our best constructed ambulances, only
through a few Windows, is renewed incessantly but gradually,
and without draughts of air; a renewal which is facilitated by
the openings of the inner covering, and which, as there is no
opening in the outer covering, cause none of the draughts which
are so prejudicial to the sick." .... After a detailed account
of the system of heating, &c., the writer continues:—" I feel
justified in affirming that the American ambulance is the best
of all the ambulances established in Paris. . . . This superiority
of the American ambulance has been admitted by the most
eminent surgeons of Paris, and an attempt has already been made,
by Dr. Depaul, clinical professor of midwifery, and Dr. Du-
breuil, assistant professor and hospital surgeon, to apply the
American system by establishing two similar tent-hospitals, of
thirty beds each, in one comer of the Luxembourg Garden; and
<pb>
these tents appear destined to give excellent results." After
alluding to the beneficial effects of the substitution of oakum
instead of lint, and of the liberal system of feeding the patients
according to the requirements of their state of health, and not
according to wholesale regulations, often insufficient or wholly
inapplicable, the author thus sums up his conclusions in regard
to the subject of his essay:—" At the American ambulance the
deaths have been only five per cent.; of seven amputations only
three have died; there has not been a single case of hospital
gangrene, and not one case of purulent infection. These figures
speak for themselves, and suffice to demonstrate the superiority of
the American ambulance." 1 In an article which appeared in
the "Gazette Hebdomadaire de Medecineet de Chirurgie," entitled
"Les Ambulances pendant le Siege—l'Ambulance Americaine—
une Experience sur les Hopitaux Tentes," Dr. Henocque writes
as follows:—
"The American ambulance merits the special attention of the
public and of the press. The installation of its little camp in the
Avenue de lTmperatrice presents a most charming appearance;
while its fine ambulance-waggons, drawn by superb horses,
have carried the American flag to every point of the field on
which an engagement has taken place. Several newspapers gave
accounts of the successes achieved by this system of ambulances,
and the favour of the public was speedily acquired by the tent-
hospitals. But the winning of public favour was by no means
the aim which the organizers of the American ambulance had
proposed to themselves; what they wished to do was to demon-
strate, by actual experiment, that tent ambulances are as suitable
for the treatment of the wounded in a besieged city as in the
wake of armies in the field. It is because the conditions of this
experiment have been rigorously observed that it becomes our
duty to call attention as seriously to the methods employed as
to the results obtained by them. . . . The interest of the
wounded, as well as that of science itself, demands this study."
After describing the peculiarities of the ambulance, and of the
1 These statistics were true when given to M. Monsnercau.
<pb>
treatment adopted in it, Dr. Henocque continues:—" Such was,
in short, the nature of the establishment; but, to render evident
its advantages, it was important to bring the wounded to it under
the best possible conditions. We know how greatly the death-
rate varies among the wounded, according to the longer or shorter
time they have been left upon the field of battle—according to
the degree of promptitude with which they have received a first
dressing—according to the degree of temperature to which they
have been exposed during their transport from the field—and
according to the violence of the shocks (so often fatal) to which
they may have been subjected during their transport. In regard
to this last condition, thanks to Dr. Evans, the American ambu-
lance has been able to make use of the most perfect methods of
transport that have ever been seen in Paris. The waggons,
which were offered to the examination of the public during the
Exhibition of 1867, have excited equal admiration on the battle-
field, by the rapidity with which they effected the carrying off of
the wounded, and also by the eminently convenient and easy
transport obtained by their method of construction. . . . One
result of the siege must be to settle the question as to the
relative value of tents, barracks, and ambulances established in
large buildings. When this point is settled, we shall no longer
have the right to be found unprepared; we shall understand the
necessity of preparing, in time of peace, the elements of the most
effective help that can be given to the wounded in time of war.
... In conclusion, I must be permitted to thank Dr. Evans,
who has been the promoter and the support of the American
ambulance, Dr. Crane, who has been its organizer, and Dr.
Swinburne, for the extreme goodwill with which they have
facilitated my examination of all the details of the experiment so
skilfully conducted by them." 1
Such have been the recorded opinions of the medical press.
But we have mentioned the names of some who were our fre-
quent visitors, and who are the most illustrious living represen-
tatives of French medical science—all expressed the interest they
1 "Gazette Hebdomadaire de Medecine et de Chirurgie," tome viii. pp. 113-117;
17 Mars, 1871.
<pb>
took in the experiment, and their gratification in view of the
manner in which it was being conducted—how unreservedly,
how completely, the simple lines written by M. Nelaton upon a
card which he left at the ambulance, will perhaps best show:—
"You have here shown what great results may be obtained with
small means." And Baron Larrey, when he declared before the
Academie des Sciences, in June, 1871, that " the question of em-
ploying tents and tent-barracks seems to have been judged to-day
by an experimental trial the most complete as well as the most
favourable," 1 bore testimony to the value attached to our labours
so complete, that had we been able to record no other, we still
should have felt more than rewarded for all our efforts to introduce
into European armies an improved system of field hospitalization.
Indeed, the interest taken by the medical profession of Paris
in everything which concerned the ambulance was very great.
Scarcely a day passed during which some well-known name was
not entered in the list of visitors—during which some new testi-
monial of approbation had not been offered. No sentiment of
professional jealousy was ever exhibited; no exclusive feeling of
nationality was ever manifested. There was but one sentiment,
but one feeling, among all: that inspired alike by an earnest
desire that the history of the experiment might tend to the
establishment of some new truth to the honour of science and
the benefit of mankind, and by a generous recognition of the
good-will which had prompted strangers, in a time of general
gloom and disaster, to participate in their fortunes, and aid them
and assist them in such ways as they could. And it would be
unjust—impossible, indeed—for us, not to recognize our deep
indebtedness to the medical gentlemen of Paris for their many
amenities, for the uniform courtesy and the kindly encourage-
ment they constantly gave us—us who had brought, with per-
haps something of our national hardihood, the first fruits of a
New World's experience, to the very shrines of venerated oracles,
to there compete with the established principles of ancient tra-
dition, and even with the practice of classic surgery.

Probably no special detail connected with the establishment of
the ambulance attracted so much general attention as the
system of heating there employed. "How can these tents be
kept warm?'' was almost invariably the first question which came
to the lips of the visitor; and every one was anxious to see as
well as hear the answer—for it was evidently the pivot upon
which the success of the experiment of using a winter tent-
hospital must necessarily turn. The system adopted was ex-
plained, as we have seen, in many of the public journals; but
in the month of December, M. Charles Joly, the author of a
popular work on "Heating and Ventilation," 1 prepared a paper,
illustrated with lithographic plates, for the special purpose of
directing the attention of scientific people to the principles and
practical details of the system, which he very pertinently called,
"The rational system of heating tents." Greatly interested
in this matter, especially as a means of improving the hospitaliza-
tion of the sick, M. Joly distributed his pamphlet freely; shortly
after the ambulance began to be visited by large numbers of
architects and others interested in the general subject of ventila-
tion, and various written inquiries and communications thereon
began to be addressed to the Secretary, of which the following is
a sample :—
"Paris, Jan. 19th, 1871.
"Sir,
"The American Ambulance has been pointed out to
us as a type to be followed, as also a subject to be examined with
the greatest care,—this we did yesterday, but we were disap-
pointed in not having had the pleasure of meeting you there. I
have the honour therefore of asking you to be so good as to
complete our information upon a number of points, viz. &c. &c.
"Believe me, &c.
"Delpierre,
"Inspecteur des travaux de la Gare du Nord."
In the month of January, General Morin, the director of
1 "Traite pratique du Chauffage, de la Ventilation," &c., par M. Ch. Joty.
Paris, 1869.
<pb>
the "Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers," made the system of
heating employed in the tent-pavilions of the ambulance the sub-
ject of a special study; and plans and sketches of all the details
of the installation, in so far as they related to heating and ven-
tilation, were carefully prepared by M. Brehan, under his direc-
tion, for the National Conservatory.
Several allusions have been made in the preceding pages to
the waggons used by the transport corps of the Ambulance.
The model of these waggons was first shown at the Exposition
Universelle in 1867, and was then pronounced, by nearly all who
saw it, to be far superior to any other known model. It was a
light four-wheeled carriage designed to carry ten persons seated,
with the driver; or four persons lying down, and two seated
with the driver. It differed from all other waggons which had
been previously constructed to carry more than two persons
lying down—principally, in having no mechanism in the interior
which could in any way interfere with what must always be the
most common use of an ambulance waggon—its use as a trans-
port for persons seated. The seats were constructed in such a
manner that they could be employed as stretchers, and also as
mattresses, on the floor of the waggon. While a few straps had
been so placed that any two common field-stretchers could be
easily suspended above the floor, and so securely as to render
any disagreeable oscillation impossible. The waggon was light,
could be drawn by two horses over the most difficult roads, and
was fitted with drawers, &c., for the carriage of the usual and
needful accessories of an ambulance waggon.
The waggons made after this model, and used at the American
Ambulance, attracted much attention during the early period of
the siege; their theoretical excellence was often severely tested,
and never did they fail to respond in the completest manner
to the objects which their inventor had had in view. So excel-
lent, so well adapted to all the contingencies of waggon trans-
portation were they soon publicly shown to be, that the French
"Societe de Secours aux Bless&s" ordered a large number of
waggons to be constructed on the same model for its own use.
After the 1st of January, the transportation of the wounded in
the city of Paris was principally effected by means of these
<pb>
special carriages—whose introduction into the French service
must always be counted as one among the many beneficial re-
sults of the establishment of an American Ambulance in Paris.
Nor was its influence, in introducing new methods and instru-
ments of working, limited to those of the highest importance;
many of a comparatively secondary value were thought to be
useful improvements, and were at once adopted. Thus it was
that the American stretcher—that model which has been de-
scribed as the "pattern folding up lengthways, in which the
poles are separated by folding iron braces "1—which was used
by our transport corps, was introduced into the French service,
as is shown in the following letter addressed to the Secretary:—
"Gouvernement de la Defense Nationale.
"Paris, December, 1870.
"Sib,
"I have the honour of returning the stretcher which
you were so good as to loan me, and which has served as a model
for those which I have ordered to be made.
'I take this occasion to thank you for the attention shown me
at the time of my visit to your Ambulance, which is as beauti-
ful as it is charitable.
"Believe me, &c.,
"Le Chef du Cabinet du Gouvernement,
"Leon Be'quet."
Among the appliances more directly connected with surgical
practice, the use of which the American Ambulance was largely
instrumental in popularizing, may be mentioned the employment
of oakum as a substitute for charpie. This substance, the virtues
and merits of which were previously practically unknown in
France, found great favour among the hospital and ambulance
surgeons of Paris in the treatment of suppurating wounds.
The novelty of the system of hospitalization employed, the
originality displayed in the installation, the excellence of the
1 "Circular No. 6." War Department, Surgeon-General's Office, Washington
1866, p. 81.
<pb>
transport material, and the general efficiency of the whole ad-
ministrative service, very early secured for the Ambulance the
favour as well as the attention of the Intendance, that depart-
ment which, in the French army, is charged with the direction of
the service de santi and the administration of the hospitals. On
no occasion, when a sortie was to be made, did the American
Ambulance fail to receive official information that its services
would be required; and on no occasion, it maybe added, did the
transport corps fail to respond to the call.
These several merits, exhibited alike on the field and in the
wards of the Ambulance, are recognized in a letter, addressed to
the Committee on the 3rd of January, 1871, by General Wolf,
the intendant-general of the Army of the Defence, in which he
says:—" Since its creation, the American Ambulance has ren-
dered to the army substantial services—des services tres-reels—
which I was one of the first to recognize."
Nor among these general proofs and testimonies of efficiency
and usefulness should we neglect to present one, which if coming
from an humbler authority, is not less conclusive, and is certainly
far more eloquent than any.
A few days before the Ambulance was closed, one of the three
patients who had recovered after amputation of the thigh, the doyen
among all our mutilated and convalescent, came to the bureau
of the administration, and asked to see L)r. # * #. He seemed
to be labouring under some emotion, which he was struggling to
conceal, and hastily putting a paper into the hand of the doctor,
hurried away. On opening the paper, it was found to contain
the following letter, which is here given in the original, as it
would be almost impossible to reproduce in English the naivete
of the sentiment.
"Messieurs,
"Je vous ecris ces quelques lignes; c'est au nom de tous
mes collegues pour vous remercier tous—des soins que vous
nous avez prodigues. Soyez persuade que dans nos cceurs il y aura
touj ours une place reserved a votre memoire; car sur la terre,
apres nos parents, nous ne pouvons pas avoir d'etres plus chers
que ceux qui nous ont arraches des mains de la mort, qui ont

"Notre reconnaissance envers vous ne sera jamais assez grande,
quoique nous fassions. Ainsi, Messieurs, recevez les remerciments
que je viens vous offrir, en mon nom et au nom de mes cam-
arades d'infortune.
"Alfred Doucet."
Just as the American ambulance was about to bring its labours
to an end, an article appeared in the "Verite\" with which we shall
close our citations from the press. The article explains itself:—
"We are happy to learn that Dr. Swinburne, the surgeon-in-
chief of the American ambulance, and Dr. Johnson, physician-in-
chief of the same ambulance, have just received the Cross of the
Legion of Honour.
"The services rendered during the siege by the American
ambulance are known. The devotion exhibited by the members
of that ambulance is also known. In the accomplishment of
their charitable work they have recoiled before no effort—before
no sacrifice. . . . The distinctions which they may have received
are the merited recompense of their zeal and their earnestness to
aid those afflicted with the gravest misfortunes. We may add
that long experience and great skill assured to most of the
wounded confided to their care cures, often unexpected, and
that the excellent system of tents, which had already been
tested during the Secession War, has offered at Paris, as
well as in America, the most surprising results. The leaders
of the American ambulance have nobly proved their sym-
pathy for France, and they have gained what is worth more
even than honorary distinction—the esteem and the gratitude of
all."1
Not including the honours conferred by the French Govern-
ment upon several members of the Committee—no less than jive
gentlemen—Drs. Swinburne and Johnston, and Messrs. Joseph
K. Riggs, and William and Emile-Brewer, were made, in
recognition of their services, Knights of the Legion of
Honour. These unusual distinctions, which the French Govern-
1 "La Verite," Mars 17, 1871.
<pb>
merit thought it proper to award to the members of the American .
ambulance, may fairly be considered as the official seals and
vouchers to the justice of that popular opinion which obtained
in Paris during the siege, in regard to the exceptional merits
of the ambulance, and the devotion of those who served in it.
And it may not be uninteresting for our fellow countrymen to
know that these honorary recompenses were not only of a
higher grade, but were greater in number than those awarded
to citizens of the United States in connection with the great
Exposition of 1867.
But the writer cannot let this occasion pass, while thanking
the Government for the honours conferred by it upon the mem-
bers of the ambulance, and for the unusual distinction conferred
upon himself personally, without expressing his grateful recogni-
tion of the kindness and encouragement the Committee uniformly
received during the whole period of their service from every one
of its agents. To the officers of the regular " Service de Santd"
and to the officers of the Intendance especially, with whom their
relations were most constant, the Committee can never forget how
deeply they were indebted for every opportunity of usefulness,
and how their very name—American—instead of being suggestive
of the foreigner and of national rivalries, seemed to serve as a
pass-word everywhere, and to be itself a sufficient reason for .
granting every request.
Whatever of success may have attended the attempt to establish
in Paris an American ambulance on the volunteer system, was
largely owing to the earnest desire of every one who engaged in
the work to contribute in every way in his power to the common
end—the maintenance of a model ambulance service.
Of his colleagues, members of the Committee, whether within
or without Paris, it is unnecessary for the president to speak.
The task assumed by those shut up within the beleaguered city
was not an easy one; but a disposition to shrink from responsi-
bilities was never manifested, and the special work as originally
forecast was in the end accomplished. To those members of the
Committee who were without the city, the president must express
his deep sense of obligation, as well for counsels given as for the
unfaltering interest they took in whatever concerned our common
<pb>
undertaking. To have conducted a work so widely known, to
have, each in his own special sphere, shaped its ends, is in
itself an honour not soon to be forgotten, while in the results
achieved we all shall find our principal satisfaction.
In securing the services of Dr. John Swinburne as surgeon in
chief of the ambulance, the Committee was particularly fortu-
nate. Dr. Swinburne was a surgeon par excellence. He had had
an extensive professional experience, and had obtained a justly
acquired and widely known home reputation. Thoroughly
acquainted with military medicine, and the constitution and
management of army hospitals, an earnest advocate of conserva-
tive surgery, an enthusiast even as regards the conservative
treatment of compound fractures, a skilful operator whenever
operations were required, he possessed a rare and highly valu-
able quality—a knowledge of the way to deal with men; in a
word, he knew how to manage both his patients and his assist-
ants ; and not unfrequently was he called upon to exercise this
special knowledge.
Associated as he was constantly with a body of forty or fifty
persons, all volunteers, holding a certain social position, uncon-
trolled by the restraints of a military discipline, all naturally
ambitious to excel, and perhaps occasionally even over jealous
of the successes of their fellows, Dr. Swinburne knew how to
direct these energetic elements, obtain from them the largest
amount of labour, and maintain in every department of his service
his own personal ascendancy.
Dr. Swinburne was assisted by a surgical staff, who, although
receiving no compensation for their services, were always prompt
and indefatigable, faithful and zealous in the discharge of their
duties, and as deeply interested in the issue of each case as the
surgeon himself. To Mr. Cormac and the two Brewer brothers,
to Mr. Riggs, to Mr. O'Connel, Mr. Louis Swinburne, Mr. Peet,
and Mr. Du Bouchet, especial credit is due.
Dr. W. E. Johnston at an early day volunteered to serve in
the ambulance as its physician, and to take charge of such cases of
illness as might be received in it, or might declare themselves
during the course of surgical treatment.
Dr. Johnston ably assisted Dr. Swinburne, and proved a
<pb>
judicious adviser in all those cases where the special knowledge
of the physician could be of avail to the surgeon.
The two captains of the squads organized for the field trans-
port service—Mr. William B. Bowles and Mr. Joseph K. Riggs—
disciplined and directed their commands with great intelligence.
The squads were drilled in the art of carrying the wounded on
stretchers, in placing them in and removing them from the ambu-
lance waggons. The waggons were kept in a constant state of
readiness—everything in its place—stretchers, blankets, water,
lanterns, &c.; every man having also his assigned place and
clearly defined duty. One of the captains, in a note sent to the
Committee, says:—" The squads, engaging to hold themselves in
constant readiness, generally got the wounded home more quickly
than the French Ambulance Corps did. We were present at
skirmishes and sorties at Chevilly, Chatillon, Clamart, Malmai-
son, Champigny, Brie, Villiers, Bourget, Bondy, Rueil, Buzenval,
&c., and we tried to do our duty." How entirely and unshrink-
ingly this duty was always done has already been shown.
It would be perhaps invidious, where all the members of a
corps worked for so long a time faithfully, generously, and often
heroically, to make any personal distinctions. It is only just,
however, to say that, in the common opinion of all connected in
any way with the ambulance, if a pre-eminence were to be indi-
cated, it should be assigned to Mr. Joseph K. Riggs. A gentleman
of fortune, married, and with a family, Mr. Riggs, before a
wounded man had been received at the ambulance, offered his
services to the Committee as an aid volunteer to go with the am-
bulance waggons and serve as a stretcher bearer. Shortly after
he was named captain of a squad. On the 30th of September
he went with his command to Chevilly, and brought off from the
field a large number of wounded. This service, arduous as it was,
was not sufficient for a nature, zealous and indefatigable, such as
Mr. Riggs possessed. "I never shall forget," said a gentle-
man to the writer, "the surprise I felt on the very day of
the affair at Chevilly, at seeing Mr. Riggs in the operating-
room assisting Dr. Swinburne, then engaged in amputating a
thigh, and that with all the sang froid of a veteran surgeon."
Such an interest did Mr. Riggs take in everything connected with
<pb>
the surgery of the ambulance, that, daily accompanying Dr.
Swinburne in his visits, he soon qualified himself to discharge all
the duties of a surgeon's assistant, was appointed to Dr.' Swin-
burne's staff, was assigned a ward, Pavilion No. 1, became per-
haps the most expert dresser in the ambulance, and continued to
fulfil all the offices of a surgeon's aid in the most conscientious
manner until the close of the ambulance, and all this without in
the meantime in any way neglecting his special duties as a captain
in the field transport service. These offices, which Mr. Riggs ac-
cepted, were no sinecures; they brought with them work, night
watching, and exposure, they required a constant daily presence for
duty, and were often exceedingly fatiguing. If it were in any way
remarkable that a person whose previous life and social surround-
ings had been entirely foreign to surgery, should have been induced
to assume the discharge of its simpler duties in the wards of a
hospital, it is not less remarkable that those duties should have
been performed so well, and with a zeal so conscientious, as to
know no flagging.
Another name may be specially mentioned, that of M. Ranzi,
an Italian by birth, an American by marriage, a scholar by edu-
cation, and a gentleman by instinct. Ranzi was one of the first to
enrol himself in the corps of aids volunteer. Endowed with all
the enthusiasm of his race, energetic to a degree rare even among
Americans, bold as his Roman ancestors, he was always ready
for every sortie, and never shrank from exposing himself where
the dangers were greatest. At Champigny he particularly dis-
tinguished himself. Having been out with the waggons all day
—a bitter day of wind and frost—he returned to the field in the
evening, exposed himself to the fire of the Prussian pickets, but
succeeded in picking up several half-frozen wounded, whom, as
the night shut in, the retiring ambulance corps had left to their
fate.
Ranzi always had at heart the interests of the ambulance, and
laboured for them scarcely less earnestly than, when the occasion
offered, he did for the wounded themselves. He was always
ready to do anything, charged himself with obtaining forage
for our horses, searched the markets and the country around
Paris for provisions, appealed to the municipal authorities in
<pb>
behalf of the ambulance for rations, and rendered various ser-
vices of a similar character. Possessed of a generous sympathetic
nature, Ranzi had many friends in the American ambulance, and
all who may have known him will assent to the justice of this
passing tribute to his memory. Ranzi is dead. Scarcely had
the American ambulance closed its doors when Paris was again
besieged by the investing army of the Government. Then
followed those long, terrible weeks of ceaseless fighting—of in-
cessant bombardment. Ranzi remained in Paris, and, ever ready
to lend a helping hand to a wounded man, did not make that
casuistic distinction between a Communist and an enemy which
was too frequently entertained by the friends of the Government.
Daily he went wherever there was fighting, picking up the
wounded and conveying them to some of the many ambulances
in the city. On the morning of the 22nd of May the troops of
the Government entered Paris, the Communists falling back
towards the Garden of the Tuileries, and the barricades erected
in its neighbourhood—the troops, in the meantime, pushing
them actively with artillery. Shells were exploding at every
moment in the Place Vend6me, around the Palais Royal, and in
the quarter adjacent. Ranzi had entered the Rue Alger, to
arrange for the reception of some wounded in a house in that
street, when he was struck in the side by a large fragment of a
shell, which, frightfully wounding him, caused his death almost
immediately.
Mr. Rillet was well known to the corps of aids-volunteer as an
active and indefatigable worker. An amiable young man, he
attached to himself many friends during the winter of 1870-71.
Rillet is also dead, but his good deeds will live in the memories
of his associates.
Messrs. Gunther and Dreyer were always prompt and ready
for any service, and the former distinguished himself by his
coolness at Bourget, where for a time he was a target for the
Prussian outposts. Messrs. May, McFarland, Piperno, Male-
herbe, Duprez, Washburn e, Pollock and Meslier were worthy of
all the praises which may have been given to them.
Major Hutton always manifested a lively interest in whatever
concerned the well-doing and the well-being of the ambulance,
G
<pb>
while Major O'Flinn not only rendered good service with the am-
bulance waggons, but seemed to have made it a point of honour,
during the earlier weeks of the siege, never to return from an
expedition beyond the walls, without bringing back in triumph
the largest pumpkin he could contrive to find in the market
gardens outside the town; a contribution to the hospital dietary,
whose importance can only be truly estimated by those who
have conducted the arduous work of treating the sick and
wounded, under the constantly increasing scarcity of a siege.
Unfortunately, the progress of the military operations restricted
the limits within which the gallant Major could prosecute his
foraging expeditions; and the pumpkin fields being ploughed up,
and well-nigh obliterated by shot and shell, the Major's return
from the front was no longer followed by the jubilant exhibition
of the precious esculent which had been welcomed each day,
with ever fresh enthusiasm, by the entire personnel of the ambu-
lance, from the head-surgeon to the cook ; and this invaluable ad-
dition to the alimentary resources of the ambulance was brought
to an untimely end.
Nor should we fail to remember the services rendered by
Mr. Hugo and Mr. Meakes, who although not members of the
volunteer corps, yet, as the executive agents of the administra-
tion, always discharged their respective duties with fidelity and
intelligence.
Among the ladies who especially distinguished themselves in
connection with the ambulance, it would be difficult to assign a
first place to any one. Several devoted their whole time, during
many weeks and months, to the difficult and uneventful work of
nursing the wounded. The cares of this kind given to the
patients at the ambulance were offered almost wholly by women,
and were of a character such as to leave nothing to be desired.
The system was this: a hired male nurse was attached to each
ten or twelve patients both day and night; at night, a hired
female assistant watched with the male nurse in each pavilion;
during the day from five to ten patients formed the special charge
of each dame volontaire. Never did men, sick or wounded,
receive more personal attention, and never were these attentions
offered with a larger desire to do for each one everything which
could be done.
<pb>
Miss Bewick associated herself with the ambulance before it
had been decided whether it was to remain in Paris or join the
Army of the Rhine, and devoted herself during several weeks to
the preparation of the bandages, compresses, &c., which it was pre-
sumed would be needed. On the opening of the ambulance on
the Avenue de l'lmperatrice, she asked to be received as a nurse,
and was accepted and assigned to the officers' tent. Here she
remained until the close of the siege, constantly occupied, always
busy in attending to the least wants of those in her charge.
Observant and thoughtful by nature, in manner quiet yet
energetic, calm but always cheerful, and apparently happiest
when the forced watchings were longest, Miss Bewick was, in
all respects, a hospital nurse such as her own illustrious country-
woman, Miss Nightingale, might have chosen as an example of
what a female nurse might be and should be.
Mrs. McFarland will long be remembered by the personnel of
the ambulance, and perhaps longer yet by those who were the
receivers of her kindly care, and to whom she was only known
as la petite mere. Not strong physically, but with that strange
'power which generous natures seem to possess of never growing
weary, she was always present and always doing. Mrs. Bowles
and Mrs. Koch were in the same pavilion, where, if the patients
seemed happier than in the rest, it could only have been because,
there nothing was left undone which ought to have been done.
In Ward No. 4, Miss Chandor and Mrs. Howland were most
efficient, and in Barrack No. 5, equal services were rendered
by Mrs. Huggard, Mrs. Packer and Miss Cameron. The Marquise
de Bethisy came daily to visit the wounded in Pavilion No. 2,
as did also Mrs. Moulton and Miss Wissembourg. Mrs. Meslier
and Miss Maas also rendered most valuable services in the same
pavilion.
Too much praise cannot be given to Mrs. Conklin, and her two
assistants the Misses Castri, for the efficiency with which they
managed their departments, the linen room and special diet
kitchen; both were most important accessories of the ambulance,
and could not have been better directed.
A remarkable fact may be mentioned concerning all the ladies
whose names have been mentioned: there were no backsliders
<pb>
among them. They remained in the ambulance almost without
exception, from the very beginning of its history until its close.
The interest which they took in it was neither sentimental, nor
one which had its origin in a morbid curiosity; they came, one
and all, with the serious purpose of making themselves useful, and
in proportion as they found they were so, their interest in their
patients and their interest in the ambulance grew strong.
Although the good accomplished by these ladies was great, in
its immediate influence upon the well-being of the sick, another
good effect resulted from these weeks of continued hospital service,
which although personal to those who gave their time and strength
to the sick, was scarcely less valuable—the direction given to
newly awakened sympathies which in many cases must have led
to an established conviction, that to every woman with a pure
heart and willing hands a vast field of usefulness is open, which
lies entirely within the limits of existing conventionalities.
This narrative would scarcely be complete did the writer fail
to allude to operations with which the Committee had proposed
to occupy itself, before its sphere of action had been restricted
by the circumstances to which references have elsewhere been
made.
On the 5th of August the following letter was addressed to
the Queen of Prussia:—
"Paris, 15, Rue de la Paix,
"Aug. 5th, 1870.
"Madame,
"I address your Majesty to-day for the purpose of
informing you of the action taken by the Americans of Paris in
view of rendering aid to the wounded during the present
war.
"On the 18th of July an American International Sanitary
Committee was organized in this city, and we have since received
contributions, in money and in kind, to a considerable amount,
in furtherance of our object, which is to give succour to the
wounded alike of all armies.
"We have reason, however, to believe that its strictly inter-
national character may secure to our Committee the common
<pb>
favour of the Sanitary Associations of the belligerent powers, and
that our agents may, on that ground, possibly have the means of
being, occasionally, even more useful than the representatives of
the German and French Societies.
"Should it, therefore, at any time seem desirable to you to
have the representatives of any of the German Societies placed in
communication with us, we shall be most happy to give them any
information, or render them any aid in our power, which may not
be in contravention to the laws of war.
"Should any one in Germany wish to know the condition of
any prisoner, wounded or otherwise, within the French lines, if
it is possible for us to ascertain the information requested, we
shall be most happy to communicate it, if permissible.
"Should any one wish to send material aid to any wounded,
we will charge ourselves with transmitting the same to those to
whom it may have been given.
"We feel that various services of this kind can, occasionally,
be rendered by us in a manner more satisfactory than may be
possible with any other Association, and we shall consider that
we have accomplished no small part of the object of our organiz-
ation, should we be able to be a channel of communication
between the Sanitary Associations of Germany and the wounded
of your armies who may be within the French lines.
"We may also wish, either in our own behalf or in behalf of
the French, to obtain information, or aid of a like kind, from the
German Associations, and we shall be greatly pleased to establish
a correspondence with these associations, which may be mutually
beneficial.
"Communications may be addressed to the 1 American Inter-
national Sanitary Committee,' 15, Rue de la Paix, Paris.
"Your Majesty will believe me,
With the profoundest respect,
"Yours most sincerely,
"Thomas W. Evans.
"President of the American International
Sanitarv Committee."
To this letter Her Majesty graciously replied as follows:—
<pb>
« Berlin, August 30, 1870.
"The Queen of Prussia has, with great satisfaction, seen from
the letter which Dr. Evans has addressed to her as President
of the 'American International Sanitary Committee,' that the
Americans residing in Paris have devoted themselves to the
noble task of giving succour to the wounded of all nations in the
present war. The Queen is convinced that the Committee will
be of great use, and particularly from being able to avail itself
of the experiences of the American war. She has been anxious
to give notice of Dr. Evans' communication to the Central Com-
mittee of all the German Sanitary Associations, which has been
established in Berlin, and which expresses, in the enclosed
answer, its readiness to give any information wished for by the
American Committee. The Queen states, with satisfaction, that
in the German army the care of the wounded is conducted
strictly according to the articles of the Convention of Geneva;
that, in all the hospitals established throughout Germany,
whether by Government, by communities, or by private associa-
tions, all the wounded, German or French, are treated alike; as
also that of the many hospitals founded for the war, the greater
number have been built according to the American system,
which has also been adopted for the Queen's own hospital
(Augusta Hospital).
"To give an idea of the activity developed by the different
associations formed in Germany for the aid of the wounded, the
Queen encloses a list of objects sent from Berlin by the German
Central Committee alone, by the side of which other associations
are working, among which may be mentioned the Hulfsverein,
and the Vaterlandishe Frausenverein, which was founded in
1866, and is now spread over all Northern Germany, and is
assisted by three hundred and thirty-eight auxiliary societies.
"In spite of the co-operation of all these different societies,
which are besides aided by the Knights of St. John and the
Knights of Malta, by the sisters of mercy, both Catholic and
Protestant, by many thousands of ladies of all classes, who devote
themselves to the attendance of the wounded, and by a great
many men—too young or unfit to serve in the army—who go out
<pb>
to render aid wherever it is required; in spite of all this, the
Queen believes, that every accessory succour must be hailed with
expressions of gratitude, and therefore begs Dr. Evans to convey
her thanks to the Committee for the support which it promises
to give to the wounded of the German army.
"To Dr. Thomas W. Evans."
The communication to which Her Majesty refers in her letter,
is as follows:—
(Translation.)
"Berlin, August 28, 1870.
"We have been informed by Her Majesty the Queen, our
Gracious Protector, of the communication which you sent to her
in the name of the 'American International Sanitary Committee
of Paris,' on the 15th of August. It is with the greatest joy that
we have heard of the spirit of sacrifice which has united your
compatriots, in order to help the suffering in the two belligerent
armies. This will surely increase the profound sympathies
which exist all over Germany for the American people. We
shall willingly do our best to contribute to your sacred work,
and we are already prepared to put at your disposal everything
which you may require from us, and which it is in our power to
give.
"Receive from us the assurance of our profound esteem,
"R. Von Syder,
"For the Central Committee for the care of the
wounded of the German army."
"To Dr. Thomas W. Evans, President of the American International
Sanitary Committee, Paris."
These letters mark out a circle of action and usefulness which
seemed to the president most important, especially so long as
he still cherished the hope of receiving the co-operation and
aid of those who in the United States might be interested in a
work of international assistance, and therewith an extension of the
pecuniary resources at the disposition of the Committee. Indeed
it was from a sense of the great importance of this more general
work, that he had been principally reluctant to immure him-
<pb>
self in Paris before the field had been so far explored as to
render possible an appreciation of the needs within it, and of the
value of the services which there might be rendered. One of
his first resolutions, therefore, after the investment of Paris had
been announced, was to proceed forthwith to the seat of military
operations in Eastern France, for the purpose of ascertaining, so
far as he might be able to do so, the general sanitary condition of
the French and German armies, the character of the hospital accom-
modations provided, the action and character of the health service
in the respective armies, whether voluntary or official, and the con-
dition of the military prisoners, the number of whom, at this time
even, had become enormously large. He accordingly, towards
the close of the month of September, left England for the Conti-
nent on a tour of general sanitary inspection, in the course of
which he visited Sedan and the hospitals in its immediate
vicinity, Luxembourg and Thionville, the German army around
Metz, and at the neighbouring posts, Pont a Mousson, Courcelles,
&c., the hospitals at Coblentz, Mayence, Carlsruhe, Heidelburg,
Frankfort, Homburg, and vicinity, as well as many of the prison
camps established on the lines of military transit between France
and Germany. Although thoroughly convinced of the large
opportunities of usefulness offered in nearly all these places to
any independent and neutral association which might be willing
to work in behalf of the sick and wounded, or in aid of the
German associations—upon which a double task had fallen, as
well from the immense numbers of French wounded and sick,
who had suddenly become the most necessitous claimants of
their charities, as from the entire absence of any organized mea-
sures of assistance on the part of the French for this class of their
unfortunate countrymen—he was particularly impressed with the
unhappy condition of the prisoners.
Feeling, however, that it would be impossible to engage in
any general work of relief, even in a special direction, without the
co-operation of others, he returned to London. Here, having
called the attention of a number of benevolent ladies and gentlemen
to the needy condition of the French prisoners, a society was almost
immediately organized, under the name of " Society for Clothing
the French Prisoners." Mr. Hankey, M.P., was pleased to accept
<pb>
the presidency of the society, and the writer of this history,
nominated to fill the office of hon. secretary, at the same
time volunteered to become its agent in the field. This offer
he was prompted to make, because it opened to him an imme-
diate field of active duty, at a time when his colleagues in Paris
were winning golden opinions by their sacrifices and energetic
and unselfish devotion, and promised very large opportunities
for investigations and experience, which might prove of the
greatest value to the American International Committee in the
development and execution of its plans. Money and clothing
were liberally sent forward as gifts to the society, and its
secretary and agent was soon enabled to go forward upon his
mission to the prison camps of Germany. But of their condition,
of the sufferings assuaged, of the wants there supplied,—of the
results of observations made, during voyages which occupied most
of his time for many weeks, and even months, in the winter of
1870-71—it is not his purpose here to speak. And if he has
alluded to this special labour in this history, it has been only
because he is unable to consider it as anything but a part of that
general work upon which the American International Sanitary
Committee originally proposed to enter, and which he has no
reason to doubt would have been as successfully and as gloriously
conducted in all its operations, had it been properly supported,
as it was in one—in that ambulance which, established and
maintained in Paris during the siege of 1870-71, has, itself alone,
secured to those who were devoted to it a nation's gratitude,
and brought to us all, who bear even the American name,
lasting honours.

Sir;
AVING been requested by you to prepare a state-
ment which should exhibit the essential facts
connected with the material organization of the
American Ambulance, established in Paris during
the siege of 1870-71, I have the honour of sub-
mitting to you herewith my Report.
Two sections of my subject—one relating to the history and
functions of army hospitals, the other to the use of tents for hospital
purposes—have received a much larger development than I had
originally proposed. The importance of these special subjects
in their relation to the American Ambulance seemed, however,
to warrant an extended consideration. I have accordingly pre-
sented them in the Report, in separate parts, preliminary to
Part III. which contains those facts which relate most imme-
diately to the material organization of the Ambulance.
Very respectfully,
Your obedient servant,
Edward A. Crane, M.D.

HOSPITALS.
HE history of hospital establishments for the sick
and wounded of armies is, unfortunately, a very
short one. The most ancient records which have
been preserved are almost uniformly silent as
regards the care which may have been extended to
the sick and wounded of armies; and it is even remarkable that
the same silence should have been observed in the collection
of Jewish sacred writings, which contains not only a narrative
of the general political history of the Jews, but embraces as
well a very extended and detailed account of the economical
and social customs of that people.
Whatever care may have been given either to the sick or
wounded soldier, in the early life of ancient states, was doubt-
less limited to such aid and assistance as relatives and compa-
nions were prompted by affection and pity to offer.
The first allusions to army surgeons represent them as
having been either priests or soldiers.1
^Esculapius, according to Greek tradition, was the first

<pb>
man (although divine honours were rendered to him after death)
who gave himself up wholly to the practice of the healing
art. He accompanied Castor and Pollux on the Argonautic
expedition, but seems to have been distinguished not less as
a master of mystic rites and a dispenser of charms than as
a physician and a surgeon. Still Aristaeus, king of Arcadia,
and Theseus, and even Jason, the leader of that expedition,
are said to have been renowned for their skill in healing
wounds.
The sons of iEsculapius, Machaon and Podalirius, who
have been immortalized by Homer, were doughty chieftains
"in arms, encircled with their native bands," to whose heroic
martial feats a knowledge of the "sovereign balm, which Chiron
gave and iEsculapius used," only lent an additional lustre.
Homer's surgeons, whether Greek or Trojan, were all soldiers.
At a later period the Greek armies appear to have been fol-
lowed by physicians and surgeons, whose only duty was to take
care of the sick and wounded. It is doubtful, however, if they
ever formed a recognized corps in the army, and their number
must always have been small. Nearly all the allusions to army
physicians and surgeons, in Greek writings, are in connection with
their services to princes and generals. So Quintus Curtius in-
troduces to us Critobulus, as "one of the most skilful men of
his profession," and gives a very interesting description of the
operation which he performed on Alexander for the extraction of
an arrow; he also speaks of Philip, as "one of several famous
physicians who followed the king when he left Macedonia." 1
Xenophon, in the Cyropgedia, insists upon the obligation which
rests upon a commander to secure the services of good phy-
sicians. This obligation, he says, was recognized by Cyrus,
who was even himself ready in case of need to assist his surgeons
in their work.2 Still, as we learn from Herodotus, long after
1 "Q. Curtii Rufi de Rebus Gestis Alexandri Magni, Argentorati," 1801; lib. ix.
p. 175; lib. iii. p. 109.
"Cyropaedia," book i. chap. vi. et passim. When Xenophon ventured to
attribute these humane sentiments to Cyrus, he was probably considering rather
what moral effects such an example might have upon the Greeks themselves,
than the historical accuracy of his account. That the Persians were particularly
<pb>
Homer's time, it was the common practice among the Greeks,
after general engagements, for the soldier to rely upon his fellow
soldiers for surgical assistance.1 Occasionally, if the number of
the wounded was large, certain persons were detailed from the
ranks to take charge of them.2
Xenophon has intimated, that during battles the wounded
found a refuge, and received perhaps some sort of first treat-
ment, in the quarter of the camp where the baggage was
placed.3 While according to Justinian, the Lacedemonians, oc-
casionally at least, opened their houses to the wounded.4
Aside from a few facts like these, we know nothing of the
measures taken by the ancient Greeks to succour the wounded."
kind to their wounded is certainly not a fact of general history. Herodotus re-
presents them as in the habit of abandoning their sick in camp in a shameful
manner; (Herod, lib. c. 135); and Darius, just before the battle of Issus, is even
said to have "put to death all the sick who were then in the city of Issus." (Rollin,
"Ancient Hist." New York, 1837, vol. iii. p. 101.)
1 The statement of Herodotus appears in a rather curious connection. Artabazus
was besieging Potidaea, and Timoxenus, the chief magistrate, had made an arrange-
ment to deliver over to him the city. A correspondence was carried on between the
two by means of letters attached to arrows shot at points agreed upon. One day
the arrow of Artabazus went so far astray as to bury itself in the shoulder of a be-
sieged Potidsean. The conspiracy was of course revealed. But in describing this
incident, Herodotus, probably quite undesignedly, makes us acquainted with a custom
among the Greeks. "Immediately," says he, "a crowd gathered around the
wounded man, as is generally the case in battle"—rov Je @\vi6£vTa Trcfictyafic ofa.i>.cf

surgeons, for there were many wounded."

4 "Patentibus omncs domibus saucios excipiebant, vulnera curabant, lassos reficie-
bant." "Justini Hist." lib. xxviii. c. 4. See also Herodotus, book viii. c. 115,
where we are told how Xerxes imposed upon the inhabitants of Thessaly and Mace-
donia the care of his sick.
s From the statement made by Diodorus Siculus, that in Egypt, "in military
expeditions the sick are taken care of gratuitously, inasmuch as the physicians
are supported at the public expense" (lib. i. c. 82); and from the fact that the
Greeks for a long time derived from the Egyptians their knowledge of practical
medicine and surgery, it may be inferred that the Greeks were at least not entirely
ignorant of what might be called an established army health service. Still, it is
altogether probable that such a service was never at any time considered by the
ancient Greeks as an essential part of the military organization.

An equal obscurity obtains also, concerning the measures
adopted by the Romans to provide for their sick and wounded.
"It seems," says M. Peyrilhe, "as if the historians had con-
certed together to conceal from posterity everything relating
to the healing art in the Greek and Roman armies. Could
anything astonish one more than that so many judicious writers,
who seem to have taken pleasure in reporting the minutest cir-
cumstances of the smallest wars, of the most inconsiderable
revolutions, who describe with the greatest care the order of
battles, retreats, encampments, the slightest change in military
discipline, &c., should have said nothing in their writings con-
cerning the care given to the sick, and, particularly, to the
wounded of armies?"1 A few passages, however, may be cited,
to the effect that some care was at times bestowed upon both sick
and wounded in Roman armies.
In one place Caesar says, he broke up his camp, "no obstacle
interposing, the wounded and sick having been taken care of"
(sauciorum modo et segrorum habita ratione).2 And in another
place he says, he "was obliged to go to Apollonia to leave his
1 "Histoire de La Chirurgie," par M. Peyrilhe, tome second, pp. 396, 397. M.
Peyrilhe is in error when he says that Greek and Roman historians have described
with the greatest care encampments, as I shall have occasion to show in another
part of this report; nor is the fault to which he alludes peculiar to ancient his-
torians. Writers of history have almost uniformly occupied themselves with
political incidents, and have rarely referred to customs, habits of living, and the
material expressions of human civilization, more frequently than was absolutely
necessary for the mise en scene of their dramatis persona;. For example, I have now
before me the "Rise of the Dutch Republic, a History," by J. L. Motley, a new
edition, London, 1871. It is a recent, well-known, and brilliant narrative of
certain events which occurred within a period of less than thirty years (1555-84), a
period of almost constant warfare and slaughter; and yet I find not an allusion in
this bulky volume of a thousand pages either to an army surgeon or to an army
hospital. Nor is there a single word in the book which informs us how the troops
engaged were encamped or lodged, or even how they were maintained. In the
index, the " people" are referred to in eleven lines, and the " army" in one line,
while "Orange, William of Nassau, Prince of, his personal appearance," &c., fill
eight solidly printed columns.
Whatever the merits of this book—and they are certainly very great—like most
so-called histories, it is much less "a history" than a biographical dictionary, in
which the incidents of each life have been skilfully grouped, with reference to the
general dramatic effect. s "De Bello Civili," lib. iii. c. 74.

wounded" (ad saucios deponendos.) 1 But army surgeons are
neither mentioned by him, nor by preceding Latin writers. Julian
(a. d. 70), is one of the first writers who intimate that surgeons
were in the habit of following the Roman army ; and he classes
them with the sutlers and the train of menial followers.2 Arrian
(a.d. 110), also speaks of army surgeons, but only to class them
as did his predecessor.3 So Achilles Tatius, a Greek erotic writer
of the third century, speaks of a camp or army physician;* and
in short, several inscriptions have been discovered, containing the
words, medicus cohortis, medicos legionis, fyc.6 These inscriptions
have induced Salmasius, Guischardt, and others, to affirm that

s See " Oruterus et Muratorii Thesaur. Inscriptionum." Also, a book received by
me while this report was in press," Du Service de Saute Militaire chez les Romains,"
par le Dr. Rene Briau, Victor Masson, 1866. In this work twenty-five mortuary
inscriptions are reproduced, which contain the words, medicus cohortis, medicus
castrensis, etc. Whether Dr. Briau's conclusions are to be accepted or not, he is
certainly entitled to the credit of having presented to his readers most of the in-
ferences which can be drawn from these titles. And I may here add a few words
upon this subject. After the Christian era, Roman armies were generally followed by
a certain number of Medici, who seem to have been for the most part either Greeks
or of Greek extraction. It is doubtful if these medici ever held an official position
in the military hierarchy; in any event, it is certain that in the time of Aurelian
they depended for their emoluments upon those whom they treated. (See " Yopiscus
in Divo Aureliano.") It appears, however, that they were recognized, at least as
camp followers, and even allowed certain privileges. Thus, the Emperor Antonine
is said to have addressed a legionary physician in these terms :—" Since you announce
yourself to be the physician of the second legion adjutrix, you will not be compelled
to support municipal charges as long as you are absent in the service of the state,
but should you wish to be relieved from them at the expiration of your exemption,
for the reasons given, such immunity will only be accorded in case you are enrolled
among those physicians whom these conceded privileges concern." (Cum te medicum
legionis secundte adjutricis esse dicas, munera civilia, quamdiu reipublicte causa
abfueris auscipere non cogeris. Cum autem abesse desieris, post finitam eo jure
vacationem, si in eorum numero es, qui ad beneficia medicis concessa pertinent ea
immunitate uteris.) See "Code of Justinian," lib. x. tit. 62. This is a most im-
portant statement, as it tends to confirm opinions rendered highly probable by other
facts, vi«., that the legionary surgeon was a sort of volunteer, who offered his ser-
vices to the legion for a longer or shorter time, and was not necessarily entitled, by
reason of having been engaged in such a service, to the civil immunities accorded to
the better class of physicians.
<pb>
each cohort commonly had its physician.1 But to say nothing of the
probably apocryphal character of some of these inscriptions, they
are without exception of a late date, and in the absence of any ac*
count of the functions which were connected with such titles, are
almost meaningless. There is no evidence to show that the medicus
was commonly anything but a slave in the service of his master, or
a freed man, attracted to the camp in the hope of finding a better
market for his ointments and balsams,2 and to whom the privilege
of attaching himself to a legion, a cohort, or a camp may have
been accorded. It is certain that his duties were very limited,
and that the little personal consideration shown him fairly
measured the estimated value of his services.2
In the absence of organized surgical aid, it has been supposed
that the Romans were in the habit of alleviating in a spontaneous
and popular way, the sufferings of those, who in war might have
become the victims of disease or wounds; and certain statements
would seem to support this supposition.
Very early in the history of Rome, we are told that the Tus-
cans, having been defeated near that city, were received by the
inhabitants " into their own houses," and that they there, "gave
them food and dressed their wounds." *
A certain Fabius, seems to have gained an immense popularity
by reason of his care for the wounded, whom he distributed
among the patrician families, providing in his own family for the
largest number, who were there taken care of, even better than
elsewhere.8
Tacitus may have had in mind some such case as this, when

p. 114, note.
* Suetonius, "Caius Caligula," c. 8.
'"Sed rei militaris periti, plus quotidiana armorum exercitia, ad sanitatem milituni
putaverunt prodesse, quam medicos.''—Veoetius, "De Re Militari," lib. iii. c. 2.
Mead, while repudiating the idea that medicine was ever regarded by the Romans
as a servile art, admits that surgery was so considered, and was only practised
among them by slaves and people of low condition. (Address delivered in the
Amphitheatre of the Royal College of Physicians, October 18th, 1723.)

<pb>
he says that on the occasion of the falling of the amphitheatre of
Fidena, a vast multitude having been wounded, "The Roman
nobles opened their houses, medicine and surgeons came in from
every quarter, and Rome took on the image of former times,
when after great battles, the wounded were succoured with care
and rewarded with bounties." 1
So Alexander Severus, after a great battle, is said to have
found quarters for his wounded in the neighbouring towns, in
the houses of the rich. Indeed, several other instances might be
cited, in which the Roman wounded are said to have been sent
to the towns and cities in the neighbourhood of the battle-field.
Certainly, one of the most remarkable examples of voluntary
effort in behalf of the wounded is one mentioned by Tacitus, who
in speaking of Agrippina, says, "This noble-minded woman then
assumed the duties of a general, and gratuitously gave to the sol-
diers who were in want or wounded, clothing and medicines." 2
However interesting this statement may be, as perhaps the first
record of " woman's work" among the sick and wounded in camp,
it is scarcely less so, by reason of its containing the implied asser-
tion, that to see the wounded were properly taken care of, was one
of the duties of a General. That it was considered to be a duty
of every commander to have some care of his sick, and to show
them certain attentions, is unquestionable. Early in the history
of Rome, Fabius Gruges is said to have been condemned, after
having been beaten by the Samnites, not so much on account of
his having lost three thousand men, as because he had neglected
to give to the wounded the care they should have had; and
Trajan has been praised, by Suidas and Pliny, because of his
constant solicitude for the weary and the sick.3 But so long as
the duties of a general towards his soldiers, whatever they may
have been presumed to be, were unprescribed, and he was unpro-
vided by the state with the means of discharging those which he
himself might consider as most important, it is very evident,
that the claims of sick and wounded soldiers upon the state for
care and succour were practically unrecognized.

The exhaustive researches of Percy and Willaume,1 and other
writers, have established, most unequivocally, the fact, that the
ancient Greeks and Romans had neither civil nor military hospi-
tals; and it appears to me as well, that even the allusions in
classical writings to the opening of private houses for the recep-
tion of the wounded, are alike too infrequent and too vague to
warrant the inference, that it was a common practice to call upon
the people of the country where the battle might be fought to
provide a shelter for the wounded. Doubtless such shelter was
occasionally resorted to, but, in view of the fact that no mention
is made by any ancient writer of a service, in the Greek and
Roman armies, corresponding to that now represented by the
sanitary service, it is most probable, that the seriously sick as
well as the wounded were generally left to take care of them-
selves as best they could. That there was no field or ambulance
service is almost certain, and Lucan's lines, in which he depicts
the savageries of Marius, may be considered very justly as repre-
senting the common background of every battle-sketch—
Nobilitas cum plebe perit: lateque vagatur
Ensis: et a nullo revocatum est pectore ferrum.2
The infrequent reference to the presence of the sick in Greek
1 "Memoire couronne par la Society des Sciences, Belles-lettres, et Arts de Macon."
Paris, 1813.
1 "Pharsalia," lib. iii. If I have not referred to a passage often quoted to show
that the sick in Roman armies were carefully provided for, it is because the state-
ment therein contained by no means warrants the inference which has been occa-
sionally drawn from it. Velleius Paterculus has said :—" During the whole of the
Pannonian war, no one of us, whatever his rank, was ill, whose health was not
sustained by Caesar's care; although he was so much occupied with the load of
weighty affairs, he seemed to be occupied with this work alone. A harnessed
waggon was ready for those who might need it—his own litter was public property,
and I profited by it as well as others. Doctors, cooking utensils, a bathing apparatus,
carried for this single use—everything was for the sick. We were far from our own
homes and domestics, but of these nothing was wanting which we could either prefer
or desire." But who is this of whom Velleius speaks? Tiberius! Suetonius and
Tacitus have made us well acquainted with the character of this man. Stript of its
verbiage, the passage informs us that Tiberius took care of the sick of his army by
sending to them his doctor, his sedan chair, and his bathing tub—which was
certainly very gracious on his part—but considered as a provision for the whole
army, the simplicity of the material and the service is remarkable.
Of all the courtiers who have written history, Velleius Paterculus was notoriously
one of the most servile flatterers. His own vanity also seems to have been im-
<pb>
and Roman armies has led to the supposition, that the sickness
rates among soldiers, in ancient times, were generally much lower
than those with which modern warfare has unfortunately made us
familiar; and various reasons have been assigned for these sup-
posed small sickness and death rates—men were more robust
and vigorous, more capable of enduring hardships formerly, &c.—
even the Platonic doctrine of eliminating the feeble and deformed,
and the Greek practice of exposing such new-born children, have
been said to "explain how, except in great calamities, so few
sick are to be seen in the Greek armies." 1 Such explanations
measurable. He is particular to tell us how he stood behind Tiberius' triumphal
car—how he was the last tribune nominated by Augustus, and the first nominated
by Tiberius, &c., and the passage in question was doubtless written, quite as much
for the purpose of stating that he himself had been carried in the litter of Caesar, as
to pay adulatory compliments to his chief—but these he has certainly not forgotten.
"0 rem dictu non eminentem, sed solida veraque virtute atque utilitate maximam,
experientia suavissimam, humanitate singularem! Per omne belli Germanici
Pannonicique tempos, nemo e nobis, gradumve nostrum aut prsecedentibus aut
sequentibus, imbecillus fuit, cujus salus ac valetudo non ita sustentaretur Csesaris
cura, tanquam, distractissimus ille tantorum onerum mole, huic uni negotio vacaret
animus. Erat desiderantibus paratum junctum vehiculum: lectica ejus publicata,
cujus usum quum alii, turn ego sensi. Jam medici, jam apparatus cibi, jam in hoc
solum importatum instrumentum balnei, nullius non succurit valetudini. Domus
tantum ac domestici deerant; cseterum nihil, quod ab illis aut praistari, aut de-
eiderari possit."—(Velleius Pateecuius, lib. ii. c. cxiv.)
I should hardly have cited this passage, had not Percy (" Dictionnaire des Sciences
Medicates") used it as authority for the sweeping statement:—" Que pendant la
guerre de Pannonie, tout avait 6te si bien prevu pour les infirmeries que les blesses
n'y manquaient de rien, et que les voitures pour leur transport y etaient aussi
nombreuses, que les vivres et les medicaments pour les traiter y etaient abondans."
This sort of historical criticism is altogether too common, and occasionally leads
to conclusions remarkable, not to say absurd. Homer tells us towards the close of
the eleventh book of the " Iliad" that Eurypylus, having been wounded, asked
Patroclus to lead him to the "black ships," and to there take out a dart and bind
up his wounds. In a historical sketch, " Sur le Service de Sante," which appeared
in the " Gazette des Hopitaux" during the year 1871—I forget the exact date—the
Homeric incident above mentioned is referred to, and the writer most ingeniously
suggests that of these black ships some may have been hospital ships, like, for example, the
floating hospitals employed in American waters, during the war of the Rebellion, and
that Patroclus was an active member of a Hellenic "Socie'te de Secours aux Blesses."
It would be interesting to know, if this connection with the ships entitled him to
wear a blue-cloth naval cap; it might serve to explain the origin of that casguette
aVambidance, which has puzzled so many of us.

<pb>
are, however, quite fanciful. There are many good reasons for
believing, that the average power of endurance of modern men is
greater than that possessed by the ancients; and for the same
reasons, it is probable that the sickness rates in armies were even
higher in ancient than in modern times. The existence of only
a small amount of sickness might have been the cause of the
silence referred to; but a much more probable cause was the
indifference which formerly prevailed concerning most subjects
not immediately connected with selfish and personal interests. If
the actual sanitary condition of Greek and Roman armies was
ever, in any respect, better than that common to modern armies,
the only plausible general explanations which can now be offered
are, that Greek and Roman armies were usually small—the
soldiers may, therefore, have possibly been better selected—that
the period of service was almost always short, and that in the
event of any serious disability the soldier was probably imme-
diately discharged.
With regard to the wounded it should be remembered, that of
those put hors de combat, in ancient warfare, a much larger number
were killed than is usual upon modern fields of battle. Men
then met in battle hand to hand, and for the wounded there were
few chances of escape. The soldier struck down was, if possible,
at once dispatched by his antagonist. Flight also was often
impossible, as Roman historians have told us, by reason of the
very thickness of the fight; and the wounded, unable to get away,
frequently perished from loss of blood alone, or were trodden
under foot in the general meUe. With regard to those who were
not killed outright on the field, it may be observed, that they were
of two classes—those mortally wounded and those slightly wounded.
With the use of firearms, the number of the severely wounded—an
intermediate class—has been enormously increased. In ancient
times, fractures of the bones were comparatively rare,—so rare,
that amputation1 in the case of such fractures seems never to
1 Mortification was the only condition which was supposed by the ancients to
indicate the expediency of removing a portion of a limb. Paul of Angina, who
probably lived towards the close of the sixth century, and of whose " Surgery," it has
been said, that "No other work of antiquity presents the art in so advanced a state,
and treats every subject in so complete a manner" (" Chirurgie de Paul D'Egine, texte
Grec, avec traduction Frangaise etc. par Rene Briau." Paris, 1855, p. 20) writes only
<pb>
have been thought of; the wounds were for the most part only
cuts and punctures, and when death followed it was usually from
loss of blood. Where wounds were necessarily mortal, death was
generally speedy, either from the direct loss of blood, or because
some important visceral organ had been pierced. Where wounds
were not mortal, most were really very slight, or, at least, were
wounds which would be so considered at present. It will be
understood, therefore, that where the relative number of wounded
who escaped from the field was small, for the reasons stated, and
where, of such wounded the mortally wounded died quickly from
the nature of their wounds, and those not mortally wounded
recovered speedily from the superficial cuts and punctures they
might have received, the necessity for an ambulance service was
by no means as apparent as in modern times.
During the period of the Byzantine Empire, some little at-
tention was paid to the wounded on the field. We are told
that there were among the troops, "trumpeters, and physicians,
and surgeons," and that there "were persons who on the
day of battle followed the army to pick up the wounded,
and apply the first dressings; we call them now, Scriboni." 1
But no information has reached us as to how these wounded
were subsequently treated. No mention is made before the
eleventh century, of hospitals, either temporary or permanent,
established in the interests of the sick or wounded.2 The Xeno-
a few lines "About cutting off extremities"—iiepi akphthpiaimot—in which he
says mortification may sometimes render it necessary to cut off the hand or foot; but
he speaks of the danger of hemorrhage, and advises the most cautious procedures.
Paul, in his article "About the extraction of darts"—nEPi beaan esaipeiehi—
quotes Homer (" Diad " xi. 515) to show that this kind of work must principally oc-
cupy the army surgeon; but he nowhere speaks of fractures produced either by darts,
arrows, or javelins; he only alludes to the possible wounding of the bone(oVT£ow TfaSfvroj)
and remarks in that connection that when arrows stick in the bones, we know this has
happened because they resist our efforts to move them.

! It is said that Asoka, the great Buddhist Emperor of Hindostan, who reigned
b. c. 220, caused certain edicts to be cut upon the rocks in his empire, and that
among these was one relating to the care of the sick and to hospitals. It directed,
among other things, that caravansaries be erected in the public highways for the
use of travellers, and that the sick and wounded be carefully attended to by the
erection of medical houses or hospitals and depots of medicine. These hospitals
I
<pb>
(lochia,1 said to have been created by the Emperor Julian, were
established, principally, in the interest of travellers, and responded,
in the absence of inns, and in the general poverty and want of hos-
pitality among the people, to the caravansaries which have existed
in the East since a time quite immemorial,2 as may be inferred from
a remark of Paula, a friend of St. Jerome, who caused several Xeno-
dochia to be erected near Bethlehem, "in order," as she says,
"that the devout idlers might fare better than the mother of God,
who on her necessary journey thither could find no inn." 3
So also, the celebrated hospital of St. John of Jerusalem, was
established in the middle of the eleventh century, by certain
pious merchants of Amaln, because, when the pilgrims had
passed the day in visiting the holy places, "it was not without
great pain, and even peril, night having come, that they were
able to find a shelter in the city."4
were to be provided with all sorts of instruments and medicines, "and skilful
physicians are to be appointed to administer them at the expense of the state"
(" Review of the History of Medicine among the Asiatics," op. cit. vol. ii. pp. 390-91).
Wise considers this as perhaps the oldest reference to the establishment of a hospital,
although it will be observed that the date of the edict is comparatively modern.
Of pre-Homeric Greek medicine we really know nothing. But M. Darembourg,
in his "Histoire des Sciences Me'dicales," a work as remarkable for the critical and
philosophical spirit which pervades it, as for its profound erudition, while admitting
that the history of Greek medicine begins with Homer, "whose poems constitute
our oldest archives," advances the opinion that among the ancient Hellenic tribes
the art of medicine was not less esteemed and cultivated than among the Hindoos.
"Heureusement le passe d'un peuple ne meurt jamais compl&tement, si nous
ignorons ce que pensaient au moment oil quittant leur berceau les divers tribus qui
furent plus tard confondues sous le nom d'Hellenes, commencement k couvrir l'Asie

cit. p. 72.) The ancient Hindoo writings are, however, by no means rich in
illustrations of medical history, and the art of healing was cultivated in India in
those far distant ages, as in Greece during the mythological period, principally by
the sacerdotal castes and as a means of obtaining and retaining power.

The primary object of the establishment of most of the hos-
pices in Europe, was rather to extend hospitalities to religious
pilgrims, and perhaps, indigent wayfarers, than to provide an
asylum for the sick. As it was for the advantage of the clergy
to increase the number of pilgrims, religious establishments were
quite ready to add to the facilities of travelling. Indeed, certain
Hospitallers are said, not only to have covenanted to enter-
tain strangers, but also to keep the roads in repair, construct
bridges, &C.1
But in the course of time, many of these hospices became
richly endowed, and seem to have so far widened the circle of
their charities, as to have received the sick. Muratori quotes
from a life of St. Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, a passage
to the effect that, even as early as the year 1070, the archbishop
caused a hospital to be built at Canterbury, so arranged that one
part of it could be occupied by sick men, and the other by sick
women.2 And it was during the same century, that the first asylum
for disabled and aged soldiers is said to have been established by
Alexius Comnenus. But whatever may have been the original pur-
pose of its founder, fatherless and motherless children constituted
so large a majority of its beneficiaries, that the institution became
known to the world as an orphanotropium, or orphan asylum.3
During the Crusades, in addition to the hospices, special
hospitals for the sick and wounded returning from those expedi-
tions, including even pesthouses, are reported to have been
opened in several of the Mediterranean ports, as well as in other
localities in Europe.4

* As a proof of the care taken of the sick poor in the middle ages, the astonishing
assertion has been made, and often repeated, that twenty-eight thousand hospitals and
lazarettos were at one time maintained and supported at the expense of the Templars
and Hospitallers alone. The authority quoted is Matthew Paris. What that writer
really said is as follows:—" Moreover, the Templars in Christendom have nine thou-
sand manors and the Hospitallers nineteen, besides the emoluments and various
revenues arising from their brotherhoods and from procurations, all of which are
<pb>
But upon many important subjects connected with the internal
economy of the hospices and hospitals of the middle ages, we have
very little information. It was not until long after the creation
of the great medical schools of Salerno, Bologna, Padua, Mont-
pellier and Paris—until, in fact, the middle of the fifteenth
century—that either physicians, surgeons, or apothecaries appear
to have been in any way connected with them.1 Most of these
hospitals appear to have been simple dependencies of religious
establishments, and frequently to have been maintained much
less in the interest of the sick than as a part of the ecclesiastical
machinery of the period, and as a source of revenue and profit to
those connected with their administration.
Thus we are told that:—" The monks of St. Anthony have
established a hospital which has neither foundation nor revenue,
but which, from the abundant contributions which they have the
secret of getting, brings unto them immense wealth. Bell in
hand, and preceded by relics and the cross, they go about
soliciting money, not only over all France, but through Germany
and Spain as well. There is not a fair, not a city, not a bakery, not
a mill, where they do not hold out their box, &c. ... In
their hospice they buy and sell. They are traders ; they are
rich. Each one has his woman ; they marry well their daughters;
they keep a well-furnished table, but in all this, St. Anthony
makes but a poor figure." 3
Indeed, the final assumption by the crown of the direction of
hospitals was occasioned by the scandals arising from the mis-
management of these institutions by the clergy.8 Nevertheless,
increased by their privileges; and every manor can furnish, without grievance, one
soldier well armed and fully equipped," &c. The statement was only intended to show
the wealth and material resources of the orders mentioned—resources which, so far
from having been devoted to works of charity, were consecrated to the development
of the ambitious political and military schemes of these semi-ecclesiastical organiza-
tions. (See Matthew Paris' "Chronicle." Bohn; London, 1852; vol. i. p. 484.)

of Henry VIII. and almost immediately after the confiscation to the state of the
<pb>
during the whole Capetian dynasty the kings of France exercised
what was called le droit d'oblat, or the right of sending to monas-
tic institutions officers and soldiers who, having been disabled
by wounds, disease, or age, were unfit for further military ser-
vice. These soldiers were called moines lays, and assisted the
monks, so far as they were able, in the discharge of the menial
services of the establishment to which they had been sent.1 In
fact, as late as the sixteenth century it seems to have been the
common opinion, that it was the duty as well as the prerogative of
the Church to provide alike for distressed bodies and souls ; at least
Seissel relates, that, in an abbey in Languedoc, there was a tradi-
tion that a certain abbot had been punished by Louis XII. for
refusing to receive a convoy of sick soldiers sent to the abbey.2
Indeed, after the time of Henry IV. it was a constant practice to
billet the sick and disabled upon the convents, and it was only as
late as 1629, that a royal ordonnance permitted a partial commu-
tation of the "oblat," to the payment by the convents of 100
francs a year to each pensioner. But there is little reason for
believing, that the convents were more exact in the payment of
such forced assessments, than they had previously been willing to
receive within their walls these unwelcome claimants to the rites
of hospitality.
Without wishing to asperse in the slightest degree the humane
sentiment of any time, I may observe, that there are many reasons
for believing that the active and practical beneficence of the
abbeys and convents. Says Burnet:— " There passed another act of this parliament
(1542) that made way for the dissolution of colleges, hospitals, and other foundations
of that nature." (Burnet "History of the Reformation of the Church of England."
London, 1857; vol. i., p. 229.) "The visitations which preceded the suppression
of the monasteries (in England) discovered, if credit be due to the inspectors,
crimes the most degrading to human nature . . . These crimes were apparently
notorious,—nor is their existence doubtful, or the licentious lives of the regulars
disputable, when their debaucheries had already attracted the Papal indignation, and
their crimes incurred the censures and menaces of Morton the Primate." (" An
Historical Account of the Origin of the Commission appointed to inquire concerning
Charities in England and Wales." By Nicholas Carlisle. London, 1828; p. 7.)
1 In England the same practice long obtained, and was termed " having garisona
in a monastery." (Archa;ologia, Society of Antiquaries, London, vol. xxxi. p. 343.)

middle ages has been greatly exaggerated. Charities of every
kind were monopolized as well as dispensed by members of
ecclesiastical orders, and in the presence of the ignorance and
selfishness prevailing everywhere, and the disorder which existed
in every state, in every department of its administration, the
most trivial and limited acts of public benevolence could scarcely
fail to be noticed, while the smallest organized effort, in behalf of
the suffering and needy, appeared all the more resplendent in
contrast with the general abandonment and darkness of the times.
The Church was also strongly interested in encouraging the idea
of its vast, incessant, and altogether sufficient labours in every
field open to the commonest human sympathies; and it is, there-
fore, that to the Church itself we are now principally indebted for
the records of mediaeval benevolence, which have found a ready
echo in the disposition universal and ever-existing, among sects,
to discover in their own peculiar dogmas and doctrines the
sources of those social developments or reforms, which are only
expressions of the common conscience of the age.1
Concerning the measures adopted, during the middle ages, to
secure immediate assistance for those wounded in battle, we are
quite ignorant.
The Gallo-Roman armies were probably attended, as were the
later Roman armies, by wound-dressers; but whether the Gothic
armies, or even those of Charlemagne, were followed by such
persons is by no means certain.2 By the convention of Ratisbon
(a. D. 742), every commander was to have with him two bishops,
as well as a certain number of priests, chaplains, and confessors
—no mention is made either of physicians or surgeons. In
William of Malmesbury's Chronicle of the First Crusade there is
1 Chateaubriand himself ingenuously declares that " II n'y a pas un beau souvenir,
pas une belle institution dans les siecles modernes que le Christianisme ne reclame;"
(" G^nie du Christianisme." Op. cit. p. 559); and for him Christianisme was a
synonym for Romish Catholicism par excellence.
2 Physicians are mentioned in the codes of the Visigoths, promulgated in a.d.
504 and 608; but as to what may have been their relations to the armies of that
people, the codes would appear to be silent. (See Malgaigne, "(Euvres d'Ambroise
Pare," Introduction, pp. xvi. xviii.), and also "Histoire de la Chirurgie" par M.
Poyrilhe, Paris, 1780. Tome second, pp. 727-728.
<pb>
no allusion to the presence of either physicians or surgeons in the
Christian armies. In Vinsauf s Chronicle of Richard the First's
Crusade the wounded soldiers are said to have been carried to the
"Standard," which was always kept near the centre of the army.
The old chronicler also says: —" The weak and sick would
have been in danger of perishing if it had not been for the care
of King Richard, who sent out messengers on all sides to collect
them together and bring them to Ramula." These two refer-
ences—one to the wounded, the other to a special effort on
the part of Richard to aid his suffering army—are the only ones
I find in this Chronicle which give the least intimation that the
disabled were the subjects of care and attention. In the
chronicles of the eighth Crusade, that of Edward I. and Saint
Louis, physicians and surgeons—leeches—are occasionally spoken
of, but the general provisions for the sick still appear to have
been of the most indifferent character.1
It is certainly remarkable that, during the centuries Christendom
was maintaining these immense expeditionary armies, the neces-
sity of providing for the vast multitude of sick and disabled,
which must have constantly encumbered the movements of such
hosts, was never seriously considered. But there is no evidence
that physicians and surgeons were appointed to attend upon
them, or that hospitals of any kind were maintained in their
immediate vicinity. Such medical and surgical assistance, as
might at times be obtained by the common soldiers, was that
1 In Joinville's " Memoirs of St. Louis" (1226-1271) the allusions to physicians and
surgeons are quite frequent, but their quality is indicated in the following passage:—
"The whole army was infected by a shocking disorder (1249) which dried up the
flesh on our legs to the bone, and our skins became tanned as black as the ground
or an old boot that has long lain behind a coffer . . The barbers were forced to cut
away very large pieces of flesh from the gums to enable their patients to eat. It
was pitiful to hear the cries and groans of those on whom this operation was per-
forming." But we are also told, and this is perhaps more important. that "the
good King St. Louis" not only stipulated with the Sultan that his sick should be
taken care of at Damietta, but that he also " issued his commands to the masters of
the galleys to have them ready to receive on board the sick, and convey them to
Damietta," and that " the king's seamen made great fires on board their galleys to
cherish the unfortunate sick." But as to the existence of hospitals for the disabled,
whether at Damietta or elsewhere, the memoir is silent.
<pb>
charitably given by the medical attendants of princes, or that
offered by itinerant leeches, or by the members of various reli-
gious orders, who were, in those times, the self-elected custodians
and dispensers of human knowledge in nearly all its varieties.
The priests, however, who assumed to practise the healing art,
too frequently found it easier to appeal to the superstitious
fancies of their patients, and to surround their practice with the
mystic forms of pagan worship, than to investigate the causes of
disease and discover remedies for the same. It was certainly
unfortunate that the exercise of surgery, so necessary in the
treatment of those disabled in war, should have been especially
proscribed by the Church,1 which thus practically for a long time
impeded the work of a few faithful labourers in a wide field of
usefulness.
It is a remarkable fact that the Arabs, notwithstanding the
ardour with which they cultivated science, particularly medicine,
when at the height of their political and military power, should
have held the practice of surgery in disrepute.2 To this fact,
however, must be attributed the almost total silence of Arabic
writers upon all questions connected with military medicine, as,
perhaps, also to some extent the prejudices against surgery
which subsequently existed in Europe.
Perhaps no more striking proof could be offered of the disre-
pute in which medicine, as well as surgery, was held in every
Christian state, than is furnished by the fact, that for several
centuries the Jews were the chief depositaries and disseminators
of medical science.3

2" Anatomy seems to have been in no respect improved among them; while
surgery rested upon the same footing, and they carried it no further than the latter
Greeks, until the time of Albucasis." (Freind,op. cit. p. 211). Albucasis was one of the
last of the Arab medical writers, living at the close of the eleventh or the beginning
of the twelfth century. He wrote quite extensively on surgical subjects, and even
gives some of his own experiences in connection with military surgery: but he observes
that in his time surgery was so far forgotten that there scarcely remained a trace of
the art. (Freind, p. 178).

During the centuries which immediately followed the Crusades
it is not altogether clear how the soldier who fell sick in camp
was taken care of, as may be inferred from the following pas-
sage in Bardin. "After the establishment of permanent garri-
sons the communal authorities, perhaps, came to the relief of the
sick soldiers; probably, the captains gave temporary furloughs
to the sick ; probably, in besieged cities, chambers were prepared
for the sick and wounded," &C.1 As for the soldiers engaged in
active campaigns, at this period, it is quite evident that they
generally cured themselves as they could. When the communal
militia were called out, they sometimes took with them their
wives, that they might be taken care of by them in case of need.
But as, until the sixteenth century, these troops were rarely
paid, and were rarely called out for more than sixty days,2 it is
very probable that they were discharged from further service,
and permitted to go home as soon as they were in any way un-
fitted for duty. This practice was certainly adopted in some
instances. Thus Grose says:—" Immediately after a battle, such
of meaner sort of soldiers, whose wounds seemed to require a
considerable time to cure, were dismissed with a small pecuniary
provision to carry them home," and he supports his statement by a

reference to Barnes' "History of Edward III.," in which it is said
the wounded were so disposed of, after the battle of Poictiers.1
In France, until the reign of Louis XIII. army surgeons were
attached to the persons of those commanding troops, and not to
the company or troop itself,2 and if the soldier profited by the
presence of a surgeon in the camp, it was because his services
were voluntarily rendered. Such was the relation of Ambroise
Pare to the Duke of Guise, at Metz; his presence, although
welcomed with joy by the whole garrison, was an assurance of
skill and personal devotion to but a few. The great mass of the
wounded at this time were uncared for, and -the only bed a
wounded soldier was sure to find, to use the sad expression of
the old Huguenot, De la Noue, was "the ditch into which he
might have fallen." 3
According to Fronsperger, who wrote about the middle of the
sixteenth century, field surgeons and barbers had been employed
for a considerable time prior to his writing, in the armies of
Germany. He recommends the employment by each commander
of a chief surgeon, rather old than young, who should be able
not only to work himself, but to teach his subordinates how to
cure the diseases which arise when many men are crowded
together. He should be present at the inspection of the troops,
and see that his instruments as well as those of his subordinates

s The only instance, with which I am acquainted, which might be cited in contro-
version of my statement is one mentioned by M. Malgaigne :—" Charles the Bold,"
says that writer, "first took measures to meet this necessity of every regular army,
and he established a military surgical service. Thus he attached a surgeon to each
company of one hundred lances. As each lance represented eight combatants, there
was a surgeon for every 800 men; and as he had 2,200 men of arms, the military
surgery of Burgundy counted a staff of twenty-two surgeons for a total of about
20,000 combatants, not including the surgeons of the barons and those of the Duke
himself."' (" (Euvres d'Ambroise Pare," par J. F. Malgaigne. Paris, 1840;
Introduction, tome i. p. clxvii.)
The statement will lose, perhaps, none of its historical interest to the reader
on his learning that all these surgeons, without exception, were simplv barbers.

were in good condition; should they have been injured, a corres-
ponding deduction should be made from their pay. He should
have charge of the medicines, and issue them to his assistants, as
also, decide, in all contested cases, how much the soldiers should
pay to the surgeon who claimed to have cured them.1
It is apparent from the concluding statement that at the time
when Fronsperger wrote, that of Charles V., if it was con-
sidered important that surgeons should be attached to the
imperial armies, their general relation to those armies was still
very much what it had been for centuries previously in France
and other European states, where armies had been habitually
followed "by a swarm of ignorant empirics and avaricious char-
latans, attracted by the thirst of gain, and who sold at high
prices the elixirs, balsams, and even charms of which they pre-
tended to have the secret."2
With regard to the medical and surgical service in the English
army, we are told in Rymer's " Fcedera," that Henry V. of England
when about to engage in a war with France, in 1415, employed
as a field physician, Nicholas Colnet. He was to take with him
three mounted archers, and to accompany the king in person.
Morstede, the chief army surgeon, was to take with him three
archers and twelve surgeons. The nature of the services of
these surgeons is nowhere recorded.3 Their rank or grade, how-
ever, may be inferred from the fact, that the following year
Morstede and Bredewardyn, having been engaged as surgeons,
were at the same time commissioned to impress as many ad-
ditional surgeons, as they thought necessary for the expedition;
as also, from an allusion to the medici, in a military code published
at Le Mans in 1416, which is as follows:—"Whether soldiers,
shoemakers, tailors, barbers, physicians or washerwomen."4

The expedition to St. Quintin (1557) is the first in which many
surgeons were employed by the English, the number being defi-
nitely stated ; fifty-seven surgeons are said to have accompanied
the army then formed, which numbered about six thousand men.
Thomas Gale served as a surgeon in this expedition. He subse-
quently became celebrated in his profession at London, and
published various surgical writings, among which was a " Trea-
tise on Gunshot Wounds." He also gives us much information
concerning the state of military surgery in his time, information
which detracts considerably from the apparent completeness of
the surgical outfit of the expedition against St. Quintin. "When
I was at the wars," says he, "there was a great rabblement there,
that took upon them to be surgeons. Some were sow-gelders
and horse-gelders, with tinkers and cobblers. This noble sect
did such great cures, that they got themselves a perpetual name,
for like as Thessalus's sect were called Thessalians, so was this
rabblement for their notorious cures called dog-leeches ; for in
two dressings they did commonly make their cures whole and
sound for ever. But when the Duke of Norfolk, who was then
general, understood how the people did die, and that of small
wounds, he sent for me and certain other surgeons, commanding us
to make search how these men came to their death; we according
to our commandment made search through the camp, and found
many of the same good fellows which took upon them the name
of surgeons, not only the name, but the wages also. We asking
them whether they were surgeons or no, they said they were.
We demanded with whom they were brought up ; and they with
shameless face, would answer, either with one -cunning man or
another, who was dead. Then we demanded of them what chi-
rurgery stuff they had to cure men withal ; and they would
show us a pot or a box, which they had in a budget, wherein
was such trumpery, as they did use to grease horses' heels, and
laid upon scabbed horses' backs ; and others that were cobblers
and tinkers, they used shoemakers' wax, and the rust of old
pans, and made therewithal a noble salve, as they did term it.
But in the end this worthy rabblement was committed to the
Marshalsea, and threatened by the Duke's Grace to be hanged
for their worthy deeds, except they would declare the truth,
<pb>
what they were, and of what occupation, and in the end they did
confess, as I have declared to you before."
Although Gale may have employed in his account more ener-
getic denunciation than is usually consistent with a rigid obser-
vance of truth, it is very certain that the English army medical
service was in his time most defective; defective not only be-
cause of the ignorance and incompetence of those who often
succeeded in introducing themselves into the army as surgeons,
but, because the Government itself understood but very imper-
fectly how immediately its own interests were concerned in the
health of the army, and perhaps still less perfectly understood
the obligations by which it was, at least tacitly, bound to offer
some equivalent to those who had given away their health and
strength in the service of the King. I find in Rymer's " Fcedera,"
among the instructions sent to Sir Thomas Leighton, who was
with the English army in Flanders in 1592, a passage which is
not without interest in this connection. It is as follows:—" Item:
where it appeareth, by all certificates sent from hence, that the
one-half or more of the nomber that weare there in Paye, are
sicke and ympotente and unable to serve, it shall be considered
how many of them may likely be recovered in short tyme to be
able to serve, and those to be retyened ; and for the others,
whose infermites and sickness are such as there is no lykelyhood
of their recovery in short tyme, order is to be given bothe to
discharge the Queen of her paye and to return them to their own
country."1
There is such a thorough heartlessness pervading this order,,
the object of which was to get rid of the inconvenience and ex-
pense of supporting sick servants who had lost their health by
their devotion, that one is quite willing to attribute it to igno-
rance, to the moral darkness which still lingered behind the walls
1 And how they were returned we learn from "Certain Discourses," by Sir John
Smythe, knight, 1590:—" Besides that great numbers of such their sicke and starved
soldiers, by order of the Earle of Leicester, were in those parts (Flanders) embarked
and transported into Essex and Kent, and other partes of England, to recover
health; of which foresaid great numbers of miserable and pitiful ghosts, or rather
shaddowes of men, the Essex and Kentish carts and carters (that carried them) can
testifie; of which scarce the fortieth man escaped with life."

and in the closets of Government offices, during the freshness and
early radiance of that morning of English national life. Bacon
was then laying the foundation of every exact science, and Shake-
speare was revealing the inexhaustible depths of human passion
and sympathy, and Sydney, among these same troops, "sicke and
ympotente and unable to serve," was leaving to mankind as a
dying legacy the immortal example of an unselfishness, of an ab-
negation so complete as to inspire him to give to a wounded
soldier near him the draught which had been brought to quench
his own thirst as he lay pierced with mortal wounds. But the
world was still ignorant, cold, and selfish, and a long dreary
period lay between the seed-time and the opening harvest.
As I only propose to give an outline of the history of military
medicine and surgery, and more particularly in its relation to
the subject of hospitals, it is quite impossible for me to notice
many facts of great importance, but which belong rather to
the general history of medical science. But I may here remark
that, although the medical service of European armies was for
many centuries undertaken, as we have seen, principally by
charlatans and ignorant pretenders, from the opening of the
school of Salerno in the eleventh century, there never was a
time in which there were not a few men who fairly represented
medical and surgical science, whatever may have been their
attainments as measured by modern standards. Hugh of Lucca,
Pitard, De Mondeville, and several surgeons of perhaps equal
distinction, even followed the armies of the Crusaders. At the
close of the thirteenth and at the beginning of the fourteenth
century the study of surgery was introduced into the Universities
of Paris and Montpellier, and for a time obtained a certain repu-
tation through the names of Lanfranc and Guy de Chauliac.
The study of medicine was still more actively cultivated subse-
quently, but whatever may have been the beneficent results of
the increase and extended distribution of medical knowledge, it
is only very recently that the soldier has been able to secure
that share to which he is rightfully entitled.1
1 Doubtless one of the causes which tended to retard the efficient organization of
the health service in European armies is to be found in the intense jealousy with
<pb>
It should be remembered that until the time of Louis XIII.
European armies were usually very small, as also that shelter
and succour might occasionally be obtained by the poor and
needy, as already stated, in the hospices established by charity,
as well as in the numerous monasteries then existing in almost
every part of Europe. Indeed, it was probably only with the
establishment of large and permanent armies that the necessity
which, during the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, those who
claimed to practise surgery were regarded by all who had regularly obtained the
title of "Doctor." After the priests had exhibited all the hostility towards surgery
of which they were capable, then came the turn of the Faculties of Medicine, and the
efforts made by these bodies during this time to degrade the surgeon and his profession
were often almost incredible. "In France the Faculty called in the barbers to
entrust to them the administrative work of surgery; afterwards it instructed them
how to perform the principal operations; and at length it succeeded in having the
barbers made members of the surgical corps. Surgery, thus degraded by its asso-
ciation with workmen, was exposed to all the contempt which naturally resulted from
so unworthy an alliance. In 1660, by a formal decree, it was stripped of all
literary honours, and if learning fled not utterly from surgery, it could only remain
connected with it in shame and humiliation." (" Encyclopedic," art. Chirurgien.)
The 24th art. of the "Statuta Facultatis. Medicinse Parisiensis," published in
1696, is as follows:—" Si quis inter Baccalaureos sederit, qui Chirurgiam aut aliam
Artem manuariam exercuerit, ad Licentias non admittatur, nisi prius fidem suam
astringat publicis Notariorum instrumentis, se nunquam post hac Chirurgiam, aut
aliam Artem manuariam exerciturum; idque in Collegii Medici Commentaries
referatur. Ordinis enim Medici dignitatem, puram integramque conservari par
est."
In England, during this period, surgery was in equal disrepute. The London
Company of Barber Surgeons had grown to be an ancient and powerful corporation,
but the practice of surgery had become so abased, that even in the reign of George II.
the question was brought before the Chief Justice of England:—" Whether a surgeon
was an inferior tradesman, within the meaning of a certain statute of William and
Mary?"
After long and frequent contests, in which the surgeons and the doctors scrupled
little as to the measures employed to maintain their respective pretensions, the
strife in France was turned in favour of the surgeons by a decree of July, 1750,
which established a complete course of studies in all the branches of the art and
science of surgery, which should extend through three consecutive years; it was
also decreed that the "masters" in surgery should enjoy the prerogatives, honours,
and rights recognized as belonging to the other liberal arts, as also the rights and
privileges enjoyed by the well-to-do burghers of Paris. It was scarcely, however,
before the beginning of the present century that French military surgeons succeeded
in obtaining for themselves the rank and consideration to which they were rightfully
entitled, as well in the hierarchy of letters as of arms.
<pb>
tor a medical department and for a well-organized and syste-
matic disposition of the sick, began to be seriously felt.
Montluc, when speaking, in 1575, of the wounded at the siege
of Metz, says:—"I caused money to be distributed among them
from the hospital which the admiral had erected." An ordon-
nance issued by Henry IV. at the time of the siege of Amiens,
considers the subject of a military hospital, and shows how one
might be supported by a tax on the sutlers and camp followers.
At this siege (1597) Sulry did establish a hospital, which soon
became so favourably known as to induce people of quality to
enter it for treatment. These two instances in which military
hospitals, or, rather, sedentary ambulances, were established are
the most ancient which can be cited in Europe. It seems, how-
ever, that the good results obtained in the ambulance at Amiens,
and which have been said to have gained for that siege the name
of the "velvet siege," 1 siege de velours, were soon forgotten, for
we hear no more of military hospitals until the time of Richelieu,
when temporary hospitals were erected in the rear of certain
armies. But that these hospitals were by no means equal to the
necessity which had suggested their establishment is shown by
the following article, taken from the ordonnance authorizing
these hospitals:
"If on the march certain soldiers should fall sick, so as to be
unable to follow the flag, the captain, or whoever conducts the
company, may give to them a passport, praying the mayors or
sheriffs of the nearest city to receive them into their hospital,
and to this city the mayors of the place, where they are, shall be
obliged to see them conducted, and the mayors and the inhabi-
tants of said city to receive and treat and medicament them
carefully until their entire and perfect cure in the hospital, if
there is one, and if not, at the expense of the city. And to this
1 This siege has been commonly said to have been called the siege de velours, on
account of the hospital then established. The reason assigned is probably erroneous 1
in any event, the term was at that period frequently used to indicate a siege in which
the labour was slight and the hardships few. Thus La Fere was besieged in 1580,
and we are told that although the siege was long, " the season was fine, the pro-
visions abundant, and the soldiers called it le siege de velours." (" Histoire de
l'Ancienne Infanterie Francaise," par Louis Susanne. Paris, 1850; tome ii. p. 24).
<pb>
end the captains and governors shall aid on their part, and the
bishops and cures shall be exhorted to commend them. And the
said soldiers being cured and in a condition to return to duty,
shall take a certificate from the magistrates of the place where
they have been treated, upon which, and the above-mentioned
passport of their captains, the cities upon the route prescribed by
the magistrates, in order to join their companies, shall likewise
be held to receive, lodge, and feed them in their hospitals, or
elsewhere, that they may enable them by this charity to go from
city to city until they reach the army or garrison." 1
This statement is especially interesting, as it shows that per-
manent military hospitals did not then exist; that the droit d'oblat
had ceased to be enforced as a means of securing a shelter for
the sick, as also that the common practice of the time was to
leave sick and disabled soldiers to the charity of the public,
or as a charge upon the municipalities. And this condition of
things prevailed in France until near the close of the reign of
Louis XIV. That sovereign is said to have made use of tem-
porary hospitals in the rear of his armies in 1672, and Voltaire
gives a glowing account of the excellence of the hospitals
at the siege of Lille, in 1707; but their exact relation to the
army is not well known. Indeed, it is very singular that Chen-
nevieres, De Presle, Coste, and the several French authors who
wrote particularly upon military hospitals during the middle and
latter part of the eighteenth century, should have said so little, or
written so confusedly, upon the organization of such hospitals
during the period immediately preceding the time in which they
wrote.
The hospital service was certainly not greatly improved during
the reign of Louis XIV. There is no indication that permanent
military hospitals were then established anywhere in France, or
that the army was relieved of the' care of its sick and disabled in
any way other than that just described.
Nor is this fact particularly remarkable, since the functions of
civil hospitals were at that time most imperfectly understood,
and the limits of ecclesiastical, state, and municipal jurisdictions

and responsibilities, had been by no means definitely established.
As late as 1662 a royal edict was published, decreeing that:—" In
all cities and great boroughs there shall be hospitals to lodge,
shelter, and nourish the poor invalid' beggars, natives of these
places, or who shall have been there a year; as also children,
orphan, or born of mendicant parents, all of which poor shall be
there instructed in Christian piety and in those crafts of which
they may be capable." It will be seen that when this edict was
published, the popular idea of the mission of a hospital was still
that which had obtained during the middle ages, and which, in
the eleventh century, had been represented by the orphanotro-
pium of Alexius Comnenus.
The H6tels Dieu and communal hospital establishments of
France owed their foundation, however, principally to an edict
of Louis XIV. issued in 1693, in accordance with which the
goods and estates nominally belonging to pest-houses, but the
revenues of which had been for a long time diverted to other
purposes, were to be thenceforth employed according to their
primitive destination; that is, as stipulated in the terms of the
act, the revenues were to be applied to the maintenance
of asylums for the support and care of the poor, and the
relief of the sick poor of the localities in which the pest-
houses had previously existed.1 In a word, the Hotels Dieu
were nothing but great municipal pauper-houses, in which a
medical service was maintained, and to which the state claimed
the right of sending its disabled servants. Indeed, these esta-
blishments, as well as those more directly connected with
monastic institutions, will always hold a much more prominent
place in the general history of mendicity than in the history of
asylums for the sick.2

2 It was only after the French Revolution had broken up the whole structure of
traditional government in France that an attempt was made to sweep away the
last vestiges of the public hospitality of the middle ages. On the 10th of Ther-
midor, in the year III., an order was issued closing the hospitals to vagrants, and
suppressing practices which, in the existing state of society, were a detriment to
the sick, and an encouragement to the idle and vagabond. (See Husson, op. cit.
p. 483.)
<pb>
The necessity of making a special and permanent provision for
those disabled in war found its first serious expression in the
project of a grand national asylum, which has' since become
celebrated in the military history of France.1 And yet the
Hotel des Invalides, the foundation of which was laid in 1674,
was established, in accordance with the terms of the royal edict,
rather as a home for disabled officers and soldiers, than as a
hospital properly so called.2 It was only in 1707 that a sur-
geon-in-chief was appointed, and for many years after, the surgical
organization of this asylum seems to have been sadly wanting in
authority as well as efficiency. Nevertheless, the establishment
may be considered as a hospital, and as one of the first of those
institutions which, erected in the name of charity and humanity,
have been intended rather to perpetuate the magnificence of
their founders. The Hotel des Invalides certainly offered better
facilities for the treatment of disabled soldiers than had pre-
viously existed, and one can well understand how the courtiers
of "Le Grand Monarque" should have said :—" The centuries
the most distant shall see in it the substantial evidence of his
liberality, of his magnificence, of his justice, and his piety." We
are told that:—"All which is beautiful, grand, or majestic in
architecture has been here employed, as well on the inside as on
the outside. Gold, marble, exquisite paintings, nothing which
sculpture or joinery-work, and all the other arts, could contri-
bute to ornament an edifice, has been omitted;" and that the
interior was arranged for the sick, as well as for those in health,
with an "attention merveilleuse;" and, more than all the rest,
1 An attempt was made by Henry IV. to establish a "maison rotate de la chariti
chritienne aux pauvres gentil&hommes, capitaines et soldats estropiez, vieux et caducs,"
by an edict issued in June, 1606; but it was found difficult to obtain revenues suffi-
cient to support the establishment, and the house was soon suppressed, and the
"gentilshommes vieils, caducs, et soldats estropiez n'ayant moyens d'ailleurs de
vivre," were redistributed as " religieux lai's " among the abbeys and priories. (See

that "on ne voit rien en tout cela qui sente la crasse des
H6pitaux."1
The history of the H6tel des Invalides, in its immediate relation
to our subject, is, however, chiefly important in view of the attempt
there made, about the middle of the last century, to organize a
course of anatomical and surgical instruction in the special interest
of military surgery.2
The military hospitals which were established during the early
part of the eighteenth century were for the most part merely
sedentary establishments, created at the several bases held by
active armies, and which disappeared with the special causes which
had called them into existence. Their capacity was generally too
limited to enable them to receive the number of sick inevitable in
an army, and they were constantly dependent for supplementary
aid upon the civil hospitals of the kingdom.3 Although fairly well
provided with physicians, surgeons, apothecaries, and the usual aids
and subordinates, the physicians and surgeons seem never to
have had that right of direction in the organization of the hos-
pitals, which has always been an essential condition of efficiency.
Scarcely had they escaped from the tutelage of the ecclesiastics
of different degrees, who for ages had had the general control of
such establishments, when they fell into the hands of the commis-
saires des guerres* who, as the agents of the war department, have
ever since successfully maintained their supremacy as well as
their jurisdiction. Another evil which befell these establish-
ments was occasioned by the system adopted by the French
Government for their maintenance, a system practised at that time
in several if not most of the states of Europe. The food, medi-
cines, bedding,—everything, connected with the material organi-
zation and the daily maintenance of these hospitals, was furnished
by contract; and more than this, the hospitals were as a common

had been created, and that the civil hospitals, such as they were, were the only
establishments open to sick soldiers.

<pb>
rule farmed out, the sick and wounded being provided with
"everything necessary," at so much per head for each day. As
the original contractors usually sold out their bargains to sub-
contractors, who in their turn sublet portions of the work to
under-farmers, one can readily imagine the abuses, and even
atrocities which would inevitably exist under such a system.
Turpin de Crisse declares that he saw in the wars, between the
years 1733 and 1741, vastly more soldiers perish in the hospitals
from a want of proper care than lose their lives in combat.1 In-
deed, the parsimony of the administration and the avarice of con-
tractors, in everything which concerned the organization and
maintenance of military hospitals, were causes of unceasing
complaint, and sources of scandal and disgrace to the govern-
ment itself, during nearly the whole of the eighteenth century.
This pernicious system was finally abandoned in the seventh year.
The importance of constructing permanent military hospitals
was by no means generally recognized until about the middle of
the eighteenth century. At this time it is said that there were
eighty-five permanent military hospitals in France.2 It will be
understood, however, that these establishments were generally
small. Coste, in 1790, recognized but four which could really
be considered as of the "first order ;" these were at Lille, Metz,
Strasbourg, and Toulon. Tenon, however, in 1788, speaks of
that in Paris as being "distinguished by a spirit of order and
good management," and as the hospital in Paris, where the sick
were best distributed;3 and Coste says of these establishments
in general:—" They are national and characteristic, and worthy
of all the admiration of foreigners, who cannot compare them
with their own, without confessing the superiority of ours."4 A

de Crisse. Paris, 1783; tome ii. p. 85, et seq.
s "There aro in the kingdom eighty-five military hospitals of the king, under the
orders of the Minister of War, and erected in favour of sick soldiers. In each
hospital there is a controller, a physician, a surgeon-major, and a contractor, to pro-
vide and take care of the troops of his Majesty. Besides these hospitals which are
fixed, &c." (" Dictionnaire Militaire," par M. D. L. C. D. B. Paris, 1758; art.

number of these hospitals were reserved for the treatment of
special diseases ; at Thionville there was a hospital for the sub-
jects of scrofula; and special hospitals and sanitaria were estab-
lished in the neighbourhood of certain mineral waters. Indeed,
as early as 1730, a hospital, still maintained, was opened near
the springs of Bourbonne-les-Bains.
Nevertheless, before the latter part of the eighteenth century,
hospital establishments in France, whether military or civil, were
in many respects badly conducted; within them there was a general
insufficiency of food and clothing; but one bed, and that a narrow
one, was allowed for two patients, and many of the commonest
conditions of health as well as comfort were neglected.1 Some of
the causes of this state of things, I have already alluded to;
but the principal cause, was the profound ignorance of the most
elementary principles of hygiene on the part of the whole
body of official administrators, who had been charged with the
direction and control of these establishments. Notwithstanding
the boasting of Coste, and other French writers, there are many
good reasons for believing that if in Europe generally during the
latter part of the eighteenth century, military hospitals were less
numerous and splendid in their external appointments, such hos-
pitals also suffered less frequently from overcrowding, and were
quite as well maintained as those of France.
The period from 1750 to 1788 is that within which the system
1 During the eighteenth century the Hotel Dieu at Paris, containing hut six or
seven hundred beds, occasionally received within its walls three or four thousand
patients. In a ward reserved for small-pox patients there were sometimes as many
as six adults or eight children in one bed, four feet and four inches wide. They lay
dovetailed together, the feet of one set resting against the shoulders of the other.

Dieu il y a des jours ou Ton purge ; il y a des jours ou on ne purge pas." (" Du degre

"It is the largest, the most frequented, the richest, and the most frightful of all our
hospitals" (" Encyclopedic," 1765 ; art. Hotel Dieu). One may easily infer, from the
frightful state of things said to exist at " the largest and richest of our hospitals" in
1765, that the administration of those less liberally endowed left much to be desired;
so much, that the soldier who for a hundred years after the nominal creation of
military hospitals, had almost uniformly been imposed upon these establishments,
might, perhaps, have fared better had he been left by the wayside to the charity of
chance and of Heaven.
<pb>
of permanent military hospitals received its largest development
in France. In 1788 all the permanent hospitals, then number-
ing sixty-six, according to Coste, were suppressed, with the ex-
ception only of eight, which were preserved under the name of
auxiliary hospitals. It was proposed to economize the funds of
the state by the suppression of the fixed hospitals, and by an ex-
tension of the attributes of the surgeons-major attached to the
troops, as well as of the functions and importance of the regi-
mental hospital. Although a certain number of French medico-
military writers have spoken of this change with regret, there is
little reason to doubt that in 1788, the number of permanent
military hospitals in France, was much greater than it was for
the interest of the administration to maintain, as also that the
project of giving more importance to regimental and temporary
field hospitals, was an attempt to improve the French army-
medical organization, precisely at those points, where it has always
shown itself to be weakest.
The military hospitals were re-organized in France in 1793 by
the National Convention, and the number of the permanent
establishments was fixed by the Decree of the 4th Germinal at
thirty. It is doubtful, however, if this number were really
opened, as "in 1814 there were but eleven military hospitals in
France which merited the name."1 In 1828 the whole num-
ber, including those of instruction and oTInvalides, was thirty-
four.
The necessity of establishing permanent military hospitals was
very generally recognized about the same time all over Europe.
Bardin says the English imitated the French in the construction
of these hospitals; but this statement is not strictly correct, as
the magnificent soldiers' hospital at Chelsea was founded in 1682,
and the plans for the seamen's hospital at Greenwich, a construction
still more imposing, were prepared by Sir Christopher Wren in
1695. Previously to the establishment of these hospitals, however,
no permanent provision seems to have been made for those dis-
abled in the English service. So late as 1664, we are informed by
Mr. John Evelyn, who that year was appointed "a commissioner
1 "Begin," op. cit. p. 150.
<pb>
for the care of the sick and wounded in the Dutch war," that
the custom was to billet the sick and wounded upon the civil
hospitals, or quarter them in private houses; that no stores of
medicines, provisions, or money were kept on hand; but that the
sick were maintained from day to day as best they could be; and
that the arrearage of the Government to the victuallers, and
those who had furnished lodgings, medicines, &c., was occasion-
ally such that their distress was scarcely less than that of the
sick themselves. Evelyn says, that but about £34,000 was
allowed for the taking care of the sick and wounded during this
war—from 1664 to 1668—including the maintenance of all the
prisoners. Writing on the 30th of September, 1665, to Sir Philip
Warwick, he says:—" One fortnight has made me feele the uttmost
of miseries that can befall a person in my station, and with my
affections: to have 25,000 prisoners, and 1,500 sick and wounded
to take care of, without one peny of mony, and above £2,000
indebted. Is there no exchange or pecuniary redemption to be
proposed ? or is his Majestie resolved to maintain the armies of
his enemyes in his own bosome ? whose idleness makes them
sick, and their sickness redoubles the charge!" Elsewhere he
complains bitterly of the suffering occasioned by this parsimony
and want of foresight, not only to the prisoners, but to his own
countrymen. "It is very hard there should not have been a
sufficient fond consecrated & assign'd as a sacred stock for so
important a service; since it has been a thing so frequently &
earnestly press'd to their Lordships; and that this is not an
affaire which can be menag'd, without p'sent moneyes to feed it;
because we have to deale with a most miserable, indigent sort of
people, who live but from hand to mouth, & whom we murther
if we do not pay daily or weekely: I mean those who harbor
our sick & wounded men, and sell bread to our prisoners of
warr." 1
Early the following year Evelyn laid before Charles II. a
1 John Evelyn, " Diary and Correspondence." Alexander Murray and Son, London,
1870; pp. 638, 640. Pepys also refers to the wretched treatment of the sick
at this period. Under the date of Oct. 5th, 1665, he makes this entry in his " Diary": —
"Item: to Mr. Evelyns to discourse of our confounded business of prisoners and sick
and wounded seamen, wherein he and we are so much put out of order."
<pb>
project for the establishment of an "infermerie" for the treat-
ment of the sick and wounded. The king, "with great appro-
bation recommended it to his R. Highnesse;" but nothing came
of the project but approbation. To use Evelyn's own words :—
"I saw no mony, tho' a very moderate expense would have
saved thousands to his Majesty, and ben much more commodious
for the cure and quartering our sick and wounded, than the
dispersing them into private houses, where many more chirurgeons
and attendants were necessary, and the people tempted to de-
baucherie." 1
The fact is, that the necessity of making a settled provision for
the sick and wounded in the English service only became appa-
rent, as elsewhere, after the army had been organized on a perma-
nent footing, and this was very long after the establishment of
standing armies in France, as well as in most of the European
states. It is certain, however, that during the eighteenth century
hospital establishments for the troops were organized in England,
upon a basis substantially similar to that considered as necessary
to secure the best results in civil hospitals. Indeed, since the
establishment of permanent military hospitals wherever they may
have been created, such hospitals have been constructed with the
view of obtaining the hygienic conditions deemed essential in
civil establishments. But it must be borne in mind that all these
establishments, whether civil or military, have, until very re-
cently, been constructed with little reference to those require-
ments which modern sanitary science has shown to be most
indispensable.
Coste estimates that the establishment or building of the sixty-
six military hospitals, which were maintained in France in 1790,
involved an original outlay of money, as follows:
Each of the Four hospitals of the 1st class, 200,000 francs.
„ Nine „ „ 2nd „ 60,000
„ Twenty-two „ 3rd „ 24,000

The buildings forming these hospitals1 were most of them old
convents, palaces, and private houses, transformed more or less ex-
tensively to meet the presumed requirements of the new service.2
Most of the buildings, constructed especially for hospital pur-
poses, were built in accordance with the plan known as the
rectangle of Vauban, that is to say, two or more stories of wards
were so erected as to enclose a quadrangular court. The military
hospitals at Strasburg and Metz were examples of this sort of
construction, which in its form is certainly one of the worst ever
proposed. The space, moreover, within these buildings was
generally exceedingly limited, but eighteen or twenty cubic
metres of air being allowed each patient, with an interval of two
and a-half feet between each bed. Overcrowding, and all the
evil results of a defective ventilation, were inevitable in these
establishments.
The hospital at Lille—of the first class—was, perhaps, one of the
best examples of the hospital construction of the eighteenth cen-
tury. In this hospital the principal buildings were so arranged
as to form a cross, the four pavilions meeting in a central vesti-
bule. Here was placed a large spiral staircase, which ascended
to the roof. The well, which served as a sort of ventilating
shaft, was covered by an open dome or lantern.
As a rule, however, the plan was simply to secure a large
covered shelter, under which a multitude of persons might
on an occasion be crowded, so disposed that the general
service of the establishment might be performed with as little
inconvenience as possible. Says a writer of that time:—" In
most European hospitals, four or five wards may be seen, more or
less spacious, all communicating and mutually transmitting the
unwholesome and epidemic vapours, which it was an object to
isolate. These ancient plans, which religion seems to have con-
secrated to suffering humanity, have only been perpetuated be-
cause the service could in this way be the more easily performed.
It is the fear of having to take a hundred steps more which

"According to the "Eucyclopedie Me'thodique," most of these hospitals were
established in private houses. (Art. Hopitaux, art. vii.-viii.)
<pb>
developes this enormous complication of incurable diseases, de-
vouring rocks, against which the profoundest observations
that medicine can suggest are wrecked without the least
success." 1
The material organization of the civil hospitals, or Hotels-
Dieu, which had been used previously to the creation of
military hospitals, and which were always relied upon by the
military administration for supplementary aid, had been and
then was even more defective. Limiting, however, my observa-
tions to points connected with their construction, I may observe
first: their capacity to receive the sick was generally small as
compared with the magnitude of the establishment, the ecclesias-
tical character of these foundations always predominating, even
after a general direction over them had been assumed by the state.
Previously to this, the various dormitories, refectories, chapels,
sacristies, &c., usually occupied the greater part of the establish-
ment. A church itself, on whose facade and walls had been
lavished the moneys solicited for the poor, frequently formed
the most prominent construction in the group of buildings; the
church connected with the old Hotel-Dieu at Paris is said even
to have "equalled in richness of ornamentation the most superb
churches of the sixteenth century."2 M. Viollet le Due has observed,
in speaking of the hospitals erected in the reign of Louis XIV.
"It would be difficult to say that the hospitals of the seventeenth
century are models worthy of imitation in their construction as
regards salubrity, hygiene, or the respect which should be shown
the sick poor ;" but, as is quite natural for a lover of art and the
archaeologies of architecture, he nevertheless discovers in the re-
mains of the hospitals of the middle ages "a sentiment of charity,
delicate as well as intelligent." 3 M. Viollet le Due, in his ad-
miration of certain national monuments, and the dispositions
for the care of the sick and infirm therein exhibited, does not
consider, when he makes this statement, the very limited capacity
1 "La Sante de Mars," par Jourdan Le Cointe. Paris, 1790; p. 438.

<pb>
of these foundations. This capacity was limited, both rela-
tively and absolutely; relatively, because the need of public
hospitals was then vastly greater than at present, not more on
account of the general poverty of the lower classes than because
of the enormous sickness rates which then weighed constantly
upon the whole population; and absolutely, because the in-
firmaries connected with conventual establishments were rarely
capable of containing more than a small number of beds, while
these beds were originally intended rather for the inmates of the
establishment itself, or for sick and infirm members of the same
or allied religious orders, than for the poor and destitute among
the general population.1 Says Husson :—" Aside from the ancient
pest houses, where the separation of the sick was a forced conse-
quence of contagion, and aside from a few other foundations of
less importance, where charity assumed the character of private
hospitality, we find in all the hospital constructions of the middle
ages the same principle, absolute and exclusive, of large halls.
Nearly everywhere the hospital was a great gallery, divided
into two or three naves, built out from a cloister or a chapel.
Sometimes, as at Lubec, the H6tel-Dieu, unprovided with any of
the general arrangements necessary for the treatment of the
sick, was only composed of a church with three symmetrical naves
that served as an entrance, and at the extremity of which was a
large hall. Assuredly that was not a hospital, as we under-
stand the word to-day, it was rather a charitable refuge, the
ancient Xenodochium, which the church opened so widely to
pilgrims, weary travellers, or the indigent without shelter." 2
1 "The infirmary itself was almost a second monastery. Hither came the pro-
cession of the convent to see the sick brethren, and were greeted by a blazing fire in
the hall, and long rows of candles in the chapel. Here, although not only here,
were conducted the constant bleedings of the monks. Here, in the chapel, the young
monks were privately whipped. Here the invalids were soothed by music. Here
also lived the seven 'play-fellows,' the name given to the elder members, who after
they had passed fifty years in the monastic profession, were exempted from all the
ordinary regulations, were never told anything unpleasant, and themselves took the
liberty of examining and censuring everything."—Historical Memorials of West-
minster Abbey. Dean Stanley, London, 1869, p. 448.
s Op. cit. p. 482.
<pb>
Secondly: these hospices and hospitals were usually con-
structed with very little reference either to light or ventilation.
The very best of them had nearly all the objectionable qualities
now generally attributed to churches, when used as hospitals.
Often the hospitals were constructed exactly as churches, and
served, in fact, at the same time as chapels and infirmaries ; such
buildings still exist at Angers, Chartres, and Tonnerre. At
Tonnerre the body of the building contains on each side twenty
cells or alcoves, in each one of which was placed a bed; galleries
were established over the alcoves, which gave access to the
windows, and permitted also a supervision of the interior of the
cells, a disposition which was also subsequently adopted in the
H6tel-Dieu at Paris.
Although the special administration of permanent hospitals is
not immediately connected with my subject, its relation to the
care which the wounded have there received has always been most
important. The direction of the permanent military hospitals in
France has been uniformly entrusted to officers of the inten-
dance or quarter-master's department, and one of these officers,
called a comptable, has had the absolute direction of everything
connected with the material organization and maintenance of
each hospital, subject only to the general control of a central
bureau.
In the management of the civil hospitals, it was only with the
Revolution that the exercise of the right of administration was
directly assumed by the state.1 In 1801 M. Frochot, then Pre-
fect of the Seine, in view of the disorganized condition of the hos-
pitals in his Department, proposed to constitute an administration
on the following basis, viz.: a central council of administration,
conseil d'administration, to be constantly represented in each
hospital by a surveillant (general director), and an iconome (special
director). The proposition was adopted, and it substantially
represents the system upon which French civil hospitals are
now generally conducted.
1 By a law of the 23rd Messidor of the year II. (13th of July, 1793), the property
of the hospitals was attached to the domain of the state, and the expenses connected
with the establishment and maintenance of hospitals, were assumed as a part of the
annual budget.
<pb>
Thus it was only with the beginning of the present century
that the distribution of the assistance to the sick, had been sub-
jected to a central control, and the service and the administration
of the hospitals, were directed in accordance with a plan which,
whatever its faults, was at least uniform and regular.
The radical vice in the administration of French hospitals,
whether military or civil, is that power is exercised within them
without sufficient direct responsibility. The ojficier comptable, and
the econome, do everything and are responsible for nothing, while
the intendance, and the conseil coadministration do nothing, and
are responsible for everything.1 Nothing could be more simple,
or perhaps methodic, than the division of administrative duties
adopted, but the practical results are too frequently disastrous in
the extreme. The worst of it is, that this system is not one pecu-
liar to hospitals, but is one of the most distinctive and salient fea-
tures of French bureaucracy in general. Whoever may have once
made the vain attempt to discover the person responsible for the
management of a French hotel, can readily understand the
abuses likely to arise, when it is not always for the interest of
those connected with an establishment, to see that nothing is
wanting with regard to the food, shelter, and attendance of those
to whom its doors are opened.
Closing here my general account of permanent military hos-
pitals, I will now resume that part of the narration which relates
to the immediate care of the sick and wounded in camp or on the
battle-field, and which I had traced down to about the middle of
the sixteenth century.
We have seen that, whenever surgeons were then mentioned as
present in armies, they were quite uniformly represented as
attached to the retinue of commanders. Indeed, there is no
reason for believing that surgeons were ever engaged, in the
French army, on any other recognized footing, before the reign
1 The responsibility, however, of the intendance for the proper administration of
military hospitals is merely nominal, as it is only responsible to itself. Thus, the
officio- comptable is an agent appointed to execute its orders in the hospitals. If the
administration of the hospital becomes a subject of complaint, the intendance sends
a controleur to investigate matters. In short, the intendance holds in its own hands
both the authority of administration and the supervising power.
<pb>
of Louis XIII., when, for the first time in the royal ordon-
nances of France, "surgeons-major of camps and armies" are
mentioned.1
Gustavus Adolphus (1611-32), is said to have first appointed
four surgeons to each one of his regiments, which, numbering
two or three thousand men, were subsequently reduced to twelve
hundred, and afterwards to one thousand and eight men; and the
credit has occasionally been given to him of having first estab-
lished a regular mihtary sanitary service. But it is by no means
probable that this service in the Swedish army, at the beginning
of the seventeenth century, was either more efficient' or better
equipped than the corresponding service in the armies of Ger-
many, France, and England.
Ballingall says :8—" The appointment of regimental surgeons in
the English army was, it is believed, coeval with their corps;" a
statement not particularly satisfactory, as it is very uncertain
when troops were first enrolled by regiments in the English
service.3
There is every reason to believe, however, that at the beginning
of the seventeenth century the character of the surgeons employed
in the English army had considerably improved upon that which

Militaires.
s As a matter of fact, it is very doubtful whether Ballingall makes the statement
quoted. I find it in "Outlines of Military Surgery, by Sir George Ballingall, M.D.,
F.R.S., and F.R.C.S.E., Surgeon to the Queen and to H.R.H. the Duchess of Kent;
Regius Professor of -Military Surgery in the University, &c., &c., &c, Edinburgh,
1838," a book in which the nominal writer has not scrupled to attempt to palm off
as the fruits of his own research, and as the work of his own pen, whole pages taken
verbatim from Beckmann's " History of Inventions," "The Conquest of Granada," and,
apparently, from pretty nearly every book upon which he could lay his piratical
hands.
3 According to Duane (in " A Military Dictionary," Philadelphia, 1810), and who
in fact only repeats a statement made by Smith (in "A Military Dictionary,"
London, 1779), it was not before 1660 that a regimental organization was adopted
in the English army. The statement is certainly rather surprising, as the word
regiment was in common use long before. Bardin, however, observes that this
word was employed in camp, as a synonym for troup, band, and legion long before it
received an official recognition, and that the doubts and disputes which have arisen
as regards the time when regiments were first created, are to be attributed princi-
pally to this circumstance.
<pb>
fifty years before had stirred Gale to indignation. Grose1 quotes
from a manuscript in his possession, written by Ralph Smith
during the reign of Queen Elizabeth (1558-1603), a description
of the qualifications and duties of a military surgeon. The passage
is as follows:—" Surgeons shoulde be men of sobrietie, of good
conscience, and skillfull in that science, able to heal all soares
and woundes, specially to take oute a pellett of the same. All
captains must have suche surgeons, and ought to see them to
have all their oyles, balmes, salves, and instruments, and necessary
stuffe to them belonginge, allowinge and sparinge carriadge for
the same. That every souldier at the paye daye doe give unto
the surgeon 2d. 'as in tymes past hathe beene accustomed' to
the augmentation of his wages; in consideration whereof, the
surgeon oughte readilie to employ his industrie uppon the soare
and wounded souldiers, not entermedlinge with any other cures
to them noysome. Regarde that the surgeon bee truelye paid
his wages, and all money due to hym for cures that bye the
same hee maye bee able to provide all such stuffe as to him is
needfull. Such surgeons muste weare their baldricke, whereby
they may be knowen in the tyme of slaughter, it is their charter
in the field."
This statement is interesting; it shows that, as in the imperial
armies of the time of Charles V., the English army surgeon in
the sixteenth century received pay from the soldiers, as also
money for cures, in addition to his salary ; that he was expected
to provide at his own expense the medicines, &c., needful; that
he wore in action a baldrick or shoulder-belt as an insigne of
his office; and that "all captains must have suche surgeons."
Clowes, a military surgeon who lived and wrote at the end of the
sixteenth century, often speaks favourably of the attainments
and character of his professional contemporaries, although he
occasionally complains of " runnagate surgeons" as well as of
the laxity which still permitted empirics to enter the service.4

although there is a very minute detail given of nearly all the
other necessary stores.1 It is evident, therefore, whatever im-

1 During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries it was also not uncommon on
the continent—particularly in Germany and Italy—to allow a surgeon to each com-
pany or troop. The number of surgeons, in an army of 10,000 men, was thus often
several times greater than is at present provided; still, the general ignorance and low
social position of the so-called " surgeons," and the wretched measures adopted by the
administration for the care of the sick, were radical defects which were not to be
in any way compensated, by the presence of a crowd of vagrant nostrum vendors and
barbers.

service at this time was still on a very indifferent footing; and
there it remained, until about the middle of the eighteenth
century, when, as we learn from Pringle, Munro, and Brocklesby,
its important relations to the army had begun to be more generally
recognized, and measures had correspondingly been taken to
increase its efficiency.
As to the ambulance, or the temporary field hospital, it is
difficult to say when it first came into use. It has generally been
considered in France as a creation of Cardinal Richelieu, from a
statement, made by the Cardinal in his "Testament Politique,"
commending the organization of hospitals which might follow the
movements of the army, and asserting also, that in the campaign of
1639 this plan had been put in practice.1 Chennevieres is inclined
to believe that ambulant hospitals were in use at an earlier
period.2 He, however, founds his opinion on the ordonnance of
Henry IV., made in 1591 in the camp before Rouen, levying a
tax on the wine and cider sold in camp, "to be expended in
defraying the expenses necessarily occasioned in taking care of
the wounded during the siege;" as also, upon the establishment
created by Sully in the camp before Amiens six years later. But
these provisions for the wounded were evidently quite excep-
tional, as we hear nothing more upon the subject for many years.
The first French official allusion to the establishment of tem-
porary army hospitals is to be found in an article in the Ordon-
nance of January, 1629, which is as follows:—" Hospitals shall be
maintained in the rear of armies for the relief of soldiers who are
wounded or are sick." And it was by virtue of this article, that
the same year a hospital was established at Cazal, the direction
of which was, very naturally, according to still accepted traditions,
confided to the Archbishop of Bordeaux, "with full power to

choose the officers 'who are to serve there, as also, to establish the
expenses which are to be incurred for food, the treatment of the
sick and wounded, purchase of furniture, drugs, utensils, and
everything which shall concern the maintenance of said hospital.
His majesty also wishes, that the herein-named archbishop may
give to the soldiers who shall have been wounded, or who shall
have been treated, certificates of their wounds, as evidence, when
he shall accord to those maimed, in testimony of their services,
places in religious establishments."1 The year following (1630)
two hospitals, one for the sick and one for the wounded, were
established at Pignerol, for the army of Italy. Nevertheless, that
the relations of these establishments to the general administra-
tion of the army were very imperfectly understood, or at least
defined, is shown by the fact, that whether he should or should
not avail himself of their succour, were questions left entirely to
the option of the soldier himself. Indeed, in 1638, a special
establishment was made in favour of those soldiers who did not
wish to go to the hospital, in virtue of which, in addition to the
hospitals organized as at Pignerol, there were to be in each
army:—" Jesuits and cooks, who shall give broths and soups to all
those sick who do not wish to go to the hospital, and moreover
a surgeon and an apothecary, to take care of and treat with
medicines those who shall need them.
"The grand army shall have six Jesuits; viz., four priests and
two lay brothers; together with a cook and five aids, a surgeon
and an apothecary. The said Jesuits shall have two two-wheeled
carts, provisions, and six sheep every day.
"Each of the small armies shall have half of this attendance, viz.,
three Jesuits, a cook, three aids, an apothecary, a surgeon, a
two-wheeled cart, and three sheep.
"The said Jesuits are particularly charged with the consciences
of the sick, and to be near by on perilous occasions, for the pur-
pose of giving absolutions, after obtaining from the soldiers " con-
fessions of their sins and promises not to fall into them again."2

This is the first account which we have of the organization of a
veritable ambulance, although this word did not enter into the
French language until a century and a-half later. Its means must
have been very limited; its personnel was absurdly composed,
but the account is none the less interesting for that reason.
During the reign of Louis XIV. the field hospital service was
conducted substantially in accordance with the provisions of the
ordonnances cited, that is to say, the sick and wounded were
treated in quarters, a few temporary hospitals being erected in
the rear of active armies, as a means of partial relief, while it was
the practice to evacuate the sick upon the Hotels-Dieu or civil
hospitals, or throw them as a charge upon the first municipalities
who were able or willing to receive them. Nevertheless, in the
opinion of the time, not only had the military sanitary service been
greatly improved during this reign, but it had attained a degree
of perfection, to improve upon which would have been nearly
impossible. According to a military writer of this time:—" Never
was war carried on so conveniently as to-day in France. The
care which has been taken by our monarch is inconceivable, and
his prudence has so entirely anticipated everything, that one may
say it has forgotten nothing which could be necessary. The hos-
pital is of great service to the sick and wounded, who under the
care of surgeons, physicians, apothecaries, and the ecclesiastics,
organized under the supervision of a director, are as well off as
if they were in the hospitals of the finest cities of the kingdom.
"The hospital constantly follows the army, until a proper and
convenient place has been found for its establishment ; to it all
tho sick are brought ; and it is the practice to leave in the camp
only a section of the hospital—un detachement de Vhopital—to
respond to pressing necessities. There is an abundant provision
of every sort of remedies, instruments, and appliances for diseases
and wounds. The service of the hospital is discharged by the
Franciscans (Recolets), who also confess the wounded on the
field."1
1 "Le Nouvel Art de la Guerre," par De Gaja. Paris, 1692; p. 44. The in-
ference from this citation is that but a tingle hospital was established in the imme-
diate neighbourhood of an army; and Le Pere Daniel, writing in 1721, says it is the
duty of the Marechal des Logis de l'Armee to mark out the quarter of the king, the
<pb>
In one respect there was an improvement. The number of
the physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries, and of the whole per-
sonnel of the field service, was greatly increased. According to
the royal edict of January, 1708, there were to be "four medical
inspectors-general of the land forces and the hospitals on the
frontier, fifty consulting physicians-major for the hospitals, four
consulting surgical inspectors of armies and hospitals, fifty
surgeons-major for the hospitals, and eighty-eight surgeons-major
for the eighty-eight regiments of our infantry ; " and the cavalry and
the other arms appear to have been equally well provided with
medical attendants. The medical officers were also accorded, as
we are informed, wages, appointments, privileges, immunities, exemp-
tions, lodgings, rights, fyc., fyc. We are at least made acquainted
in this edict with all the elements of an effective organization, and
however loosely they may have been bound together, or chaotically
they may have at times come in contact with certain parts of the
machinery of the general administration, or indifferently they
may have been provided with the means of treating either sick
or wounded, they, doubtless through individual and personal
efforts, often did good service. Says Audouin:—" Admitting
ambulances to have only been established so late as the sixteenth
century, and sedentary military hospitals in the seventeenth
century, France still would have the priority over all other
nations, for no one in those times, and not even after the ex-
ample given by France, had military hospitals. Every people
continued to treat the wounded and the sick in tents and quar-
ters. The Austrians, the Prussians, the Danes, and the Swedes,
imitated the French only towards the middle of the eighteenth
century. The English had hospitals only a little earlier, but
long after the French, and were still experimenting with their
regimental hospitals And it must be said, to the
glory of French surgery, that if the hospital administration was
more complete than abroad, the excellence of the surgical service
contributed most powerfully to that difference."1

During the early part of the reign of Louis XV. the service de
sante in the French army was the subject of various ordonnances,
which, if they added very little to its efficiency, began at least to
develope the outlines of what shortly and suddenly, in 1746 and
1747, under the administration of Count d'Argenson, became a
minutely systematized service.
By the "Reglement General" of January 1st, 1747, the mili-
tary hospitals were divided into the Jived, the sedentary, and the
ambulant; and the functions of each class are pretty clearly defined.
Those of the ambulant hospital are very well indicated in an
"Instruction for the Commissary in charge of the Ambulant
Hospital,''prepared by d'Argenson in 1746:
"When an army moves from one place to another, the com-
missary ought to go with the camping material to establish the
hospital in its assigned place, in order to be ready to receive the
sick who may be sent in from the army.
"Before the action commences, the commissary should estab-
lish the hospital in the nearest and most suitable houses, and
should get the surgeons and nurses together, as well as every-
thing necessary for dressing the wounds. He should neglect
nothing to remove the wounded from the field, and to secure for
them the promptest succour.
"In the case of a siege, he should choose the most suitable
places, and those nearest to the trenches, for the ambulant hos-
pital; he should have beds placed within it, and everything
prepared for receiving the wounded. One is almost always
obliged to have recourse to barns, and in this case it is well to
have a floor laid down, should the nature of the ground and the
season require it, as also to have sashes put into the windows, in
order to protect the sick against the vicissitudes of the weather. A
separate ambulant hospital should be maintained at each point of
attack,"1 &c., &c.
An order, "to be observed on the march by the employes of
the ambulant hospital," issued by Marshal de Belle-Isle in 1759,
shows a completeness at that time, in the organization of this
portion of the hospital service of the French army, which is cer-
1 "Details Militaires," par M. De Chennevieres, tome ii. pp. 152, 154, 155.
<pb>
tainly surprising. The hospital was to move with an escort,
divided into three corps, one at the head of the convoy, another
at the rear, the third being distributed along the line—all under
the charge of a sub-director, "whom they are expressly enjoined
to obey."
The architect, the captain of the workmen, at the head of the
joiners, the masons, the locksmiths, and the other workmen of the
ambulant hospital, will precede the vanguard, to repair the road,
fill up the hollows and the ruts, and cut the wood necessary for
their reparation, but they will pay great attention that they spare
the fruit-trees. Each workman will carry in his hand the tool of
his trade, which he can use to the best advantage en route, in
order that this tool may make known who he is, and that he always
may be ready to work usefully.
"When the convoy approaches the place where it is to pass the
night, and its march may no longer be retarded by bad roads,
the architect and captain of the workmen, conducted by one of
the clerks, who shall have reconnoitred the country, will go to
the place selected, to make, with all diligence, the reparations
necessary, and render the place where the sick are to be received
the most suitable, according to the season.
"Two of the best mounted employes will march every day in
the rear of the troops, whose line of march may be within reach
of the convoy, for the purpose of picking up the sick soldiers
whom they may find upon the way, in the woods and thickets
and in the houses of the villages, on the right and on the left, to
the distance of a quarter of a league. They will visit carefully
the houses, one beginning at one end of the village, the other by
the other end, and without exposing themselves. They shall
have, each one, under their orders an infermier-major and twelve
infermiers (nurses or hospital corps men), carrying two stretchers.
In case the infermiers are not sufficient for the transport, they
shall obtain the aid of well disposed soldiers, whom they shall
pay reasonably for their service. The sick shall be placed upon
carriages, or empty caissons prepared to receive them, and which
shall form the line of the convoy. Those who accompany them
will take care to give the sick, immediately, the assistance which
they are expected to give."
<pb>
"As soon as the sick are thus disposed of, the two employes
will make a new search, and always separately, except there be
in a single place enough sick to occupy both at the same time. If
they have occasion for one or several waggons to go after the
sick, they will demand the waggons of those who have charge of
them; they will understand how contrary it would be to humanity
to abandon by negligence any of these poor sick, or to fail to
treat them with the gentleness which charity and their situation
require.
"The infermiers shall be divided into squads of twelve—a ward
clerk and an infermier-major shall be at the head of each squad.
The infermiers-major and all the others shall wear in the
button-hole of the coat a tin slip, marked "H," to indicate who
they are. Those who shall conceal this mark shall be subject to
a fine of six livres on the first offence, and shall be expelled in
case it is repeated. The sub-director shall distribute the squads
at the head, in the rear, and along the line of the convoy—
that they may watch the things placed in the waggons, cause
these to follow without intervals, aid the drivers when the wag-
gons are stuck in the mud—and principally, that they may give
prompt succour as well to the sick who are in the convoy as to
those who may be brought to it," &c., &c.1
I have here presented some of the most interesting passages
from the forty-two articles which compose this order, and which
indicate the duties of the chief director, the sub-director, and the
inspector, the employes, officers, and stretcher-bearers, domestics,
teamsters, butcher-boys and drovers, master-butchers, architect,

as also the several functions of the establishment, are described
with great detail.
This organization was evidently altogether too complicated and
unwieldy; but a more complete and elaborate system it would
have been very difficult to have created. The modifications
which have since been adopted in France have added nothing to
the organization; with certain simplifications it represents the
system now existing.
Formerly the surgeon-in-chief had under his orders all the
other surgeons, whether attached to hospitals or regiments, and
an engagement being imminent, those surgeons not absolutely
necessary, either in the hospitals or among the troops, were called
together at head-quarters, and assigned to the ambulances—or
corps for field service.1 During the wars of the first Empire, the
surgical staff of the ambulance corps became an independent
branch or section of the general service de sauti.2
The transport service was improved by Larreyand Percy, who
introduced special and lighter waggons, and partially reformed
its personnel; indeed, it is in this respect more than in any other
that the ambulance system has been improved, since the beginning
of this century. Perhaps I could not better show how little the
constitution of the French Ambulance service has changed since
1 Decret du 16 ventose, an. II. ArrSte du 24 thermidor, an. VIII.
s Since 1792 the Service de Sante in the French army, has been the occasion of
various decrees, which have changed its relations to the administration, as well as
the organization of its personnel. Nevertheless, its organization has always had
reference to three distinct branches of the health service. Surgeons and physicians
have, accordingly, been assigned to the hospitals, the ambulances, and the regiments.
To the hospitals medical officers are assigned, both in number and in rank, "ac-
cording to the importance of the establishment."
To the troops they are attached according to the following schedule:—
To a regiment of infantry, (strength about 3,000)—
One surgeon-major of the 1st class.
One surgeon-major of the 2nd class.
One aid-major.
The ambulances are divided into those attached to the head-quarters of the army,
the head-quarters of the several corps, and the head-quarters of the divisions forming
those corps; and the personnel varies both in number and rank in a descending
scale, or in accordance with the importance of the service. The ambulances attached
to the head-quarters of the army, and to a division of infantry, are usually composed
about as follows:—

Unfortunately, however, the numerical strength of the regular medical corps of
the French army is by no means as considerable as these statements would seem to
indicate. Thus, during the recent war, it was frequently the case that but a single
medical officer was connected with the regiment, and he often held only the rank
of an aid-major. In the organization of the regiments of the garde mobile but one
medical officer was allowed.
1 I here give the personal composition of one of these ambulance corps, but they
<pb>
An ambulance company such as this, however theoretically
complete it may be, has within it all the elements of disorder and
inefficiency, which will speedily make their appearance after the
corps is sent into the field. A hundred years' experience had
nevertheless, not convinced the French of the impracticability of
the organization ; it had dazzled the eye of whoever had heard
of it, or read about it, with a show of having provided one or
more persons for each special service connected with an
ambulant hospital, while its mobility, its co-operative power, and
its capacity for work, have always been pretty much inversely as
the numerical and apparent force of the corps. The disastrous
campaign of 1870-71, showed, at least, the worthlessness of such
complicated organizations. They were found not only too
clumsy to be anywhere efficient, but unprovided with an amount
of hospital material proportionate to their personal strength, the
services rendered by them were almost always simply primary;
without breaking up the corps by details, it was found impossible
to maintain a field hospital or sedentary ambulance. The result
was, that these enormous companies were most of the time, until
disbanded, either marching about the country, or idly waiting
for a battle to furnish them the occasion for a little short-lived
activity.
On the 4th October, 1870, the "Societe de Secours aux BlesseV'
disbanded the thirteen ambulance corps which it had sent into
the field. Several of the corps were, however, immediately re-
organized on the following basis, viz: The personnel was to consist
of one surgeon in chief, ten surgeons, one chaplain, and five
stretcher-bearers or nurses. The material was to consist of one
two-horse waggon, a small one-horse carriage, and a saddle-horse.
In the waggon, all the baggage and surgical and medical appliances
were to be carried; the small carriage was to be used on the
field, to convey rapidly from point to point assistance and sup-
plies for the wounded; the saddle-horse was employed by the
surgeon, who served in the ambulance as a scout. An am-
seem never to have been constructed upon any well-defined basis. Thus, the " Fifth
Ambulance " contained 41 surgeons and assistants, 5 comptables or book-keepers, and
121 infermiers, waggon drivers, corporals, <fec.
<pb>
bulance corps thus constituted was divided into two sec-
tions.1
It is very evident that much more of mobility must have been
secured by this simplification of the organization. These new
corps were, however, not provided with sufficient material, they
had no ambulance waggons, properly speaking, they could carry
but few surgical supplies in their two-horse waggons, and there
were few if any well organized and well provisioned depots ac-
cessible. Moreover, their relations to the military administration
were quite undefined, and consequently unsatisfactory.
Whatever improvements may have been introduced into the
field service of the British army from 1750 to 1815, indeed I
might say down to the present time, have been of a character
rather general than special. In the first place: more and more
official importance has been attached to the duties of the army
medical officer, and more respect has been shown him personally.
It may be true that, so late as 1788, the surgeon was sometimes
overlooked on ceremonial occasions. Indeed this seems to have
been a cause of great grief to Hamilton, who takes the special
pains to tell us that "when his Majesty, in the year 1788, re-
viewed the camps, no surgeon was allowed to kiss his hand "2—
a dishonour considered all the more intolerable, because even the
chaplain was considered worthy of this osculatory favour.3 Never-
theless, the position of the surgeon had greatly improved. His pay

matters relating to military rank, and that a greater effort has been made, by mili-
tary medical officers, to prove that in certain cases they have been treated with dis-
respect, than to prove that they have in general been held in modern armies in quite
as much consideration as other non-combatant officers. Thus, the following adver-
tisement, which appeared in the London Gazette in 1689, has been quoted a good
many times. (See "Remarks on Army Surgeons and their Work," by Charles
Alexander Gordon, M.D.) "Run away out of Captain Soames company in his Grace
the Duke of Norfolk's Regiment of Infantry, Roger Curtis, a barber-surgeon; a
little man with short black hair, a little curled; round visage, fresh-coloured; in a
light coloured cloth coat, with gold and silver buttons, and the loops stitched up with
gold and silver; red plush breeches and white hat. Whoever will give notice to
<pb>
had been increased,1 and with the prospect of rising in his pro-
fession, he actually possessed, if not the companionship of kings,
at least that of such men as Munro, Rollo, Home, Hamilton, John
Bell, and of one greater than all—John Hunter. The necessities of
the great continental wars, in which the English Government was
shortly after engaged, led to a variety of liberal concessions which
enabled it to secure the services of many able and skilful surgeons.
Sir James Macgrigor, after having alluded to the difficulty of
obtaining well qualified surgeons at the outbreak of these wars,
a difficulty which forced the Government to have recourse to
advertisements in the newspapers, the posting of placards in the
great cities of England, and the adoption of a very low standard
of professional requirement, yet was able to say at the end
Francis Baker, the agent of the same regiment in Hatton Gardens, so that he may
be secured, shall have two guineas reward!" But it will be noticed, that this " run
away" was qualified as a " company and barber-surgeon." Many army surgeons at
this time were doubtless " barber-surgeons;" nevertheless, the English regimental
surgeon is generally spoken of with respect during the whole of the seventeenth cen-
tury, and seems to have ranked with the " preacher" and " quartermaster." Thus
I find in manuscript No. 6008, of the "Harleian Collection," and dated 1649,
that " ye preacher, quartermaster, chirurgian, and ye waggon master of ye regi-
ment" are spoken of in the same connection—" whos huttes are to be placed even
with ye captains huttes." The pay of" preachers" and chirurgiens" seems to have
been nearly the same, during the whole of the seventeenth century. Thus, in a
pay-list for the year 1639, four regimental preachers are entered at 3s. each per diem,
and four chirurgeons at 4s. each per diem. In a list for 1697 the (regimental)
chaplain is entered at 3s. 4d. per diem. In the middle of the seventeenth
century, the chaplain appears to have had the advantage of the surgeon in the
matter of pay, as he is inscribed in a "marching regiment of foot" at 6s. 8d.
per diem, and the surgeon at 4s. But during the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries, the pay of both the surgeon and the chaplain was considerably above
that of the quartermaster, as also of every officer below the rank of a captain.
(See papers cited by Grose, vol. i. pp. 291-322.) The surgeon, it is true, was
expected to provide medicines, &c., but his allowances and special perquisites, of
one sort or another, were presumed to cover the expenditure necessary for that
purpose. Company surgeons and surgeon's mates were for a long time noncommis-
sioned officers, and were subject to the same discipline as the private soldier,
however ignominious might be the consequences. (See Hamilton, op. cit. vol. ii.
p. 163, and Gordon, op. cit., p. 56.)
1 See "Keport of the Commissioners appointed to inquire into the Kegulations
affecting the Sanitary Condition of the Army." Appendix xiii. London, 1858.
In 1793 the surgeon's pay was raised to ten shillings per day, with an allowance
of two horses "for self and medicine-chest," and an annual money allowance for
the horses of £37 16s. (Grose, op. cit. vol. i. pp. 320-322.)
<pb>
of the wars:—" In the ranks of the medical officers of the
army, men are to be found upon a level, at least, with those in
the Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons of London, Edinburgh,
and Dublin," and that, "taking the profession in civil life gene-
rally, there are comprised in the body of the medical officers of
the army not fewer men of literary attainments and university
education, than in the ranks of civil life." 1 Indeed, since the
beginning of the present century, the English army medical
officers have been, as a body, both better educated and of a better
class, and a higher social tone has obtained among them. A singu-
lar evidence of this is shown in the practice, quite common among
them at the close of the last century, of obtaining, in addition to
the medical commission, a military commission which secured
not only rank to the holder, but placed him in the line of regular
promotion.
In the second place: medical and surgical stores have been
more abundantly furnished.
One of the faults of the old system was, that surgeons, al-
though miserably paid, were nevertheless expected to provide, at
their own cost, the medicines, &c., to be given to the sick ; and
they seem, at a time not very remote, to have been even ex-
pected to pay out of the meagre pittance allowed them, the hire
of buildings used as hospitals.2
At the close of the eighteenth century, the surgeon re-
ceived an allowance of £30 per annum, for the rent of the regi-
mental hospital, and £70 per annum for the purchase of medicines,
1 "Autobiography," p. 191. Quoted by Gordon in op. cit. p. 97.
""The great difficulty found by most regiments in procuring an hospital for
their sick, renders a clause in the Mutiny Act for that purpose much wanted; it
would be a very considerable benefit to the service, if the magistrates of every
district wherein troops should be quartered were obliged to provide a convenient
barn, stable, or other building, at a reasonable rent. For want of some such regu-
lation, the most exorbitant demands are usually made for the most wretched hovels,
though the slender allowance to a regimental surgeon enables him to afford very
little, particularly where the regiment is in scattered quarters, as in that case he
must have two or more hospitals; the consequence is, that many a life is lost,
which, with proper accommodation, might have been saved; in villages, parish
officers might be obliged to take sick soldiers into their parish poor houses, assign-
ing them one or more rooms, according to their numbers."—Grose, op. cit. vol. ii.
pp. 76, 77.
<pb>
and that, in addition to a medicine chest furnished by the go-
vernment.1 Subsequently, the hospitals were furnished with
medicines, clothing, and food even, through a purveyor's depart-
ment; although the English hospital surgeon has very gene-
rally enjoyed the liberty of making purchases at discretion, to
supply the wants of the hospital, a relic of the old system, with this
difference—if justifiable, such purchases have been allowed
by the government. Thirdly: as early as 1756, the army
medical service was placed under the control of a hospital board;
in the words of the ordonnance "for the medical service of the
army intended to take the field, that under their constant direc-
tion this part of military service (relating alike to medicines,
hospital stores, and every other requisite provision for the sick)
might be carried into execution with ability, regularity, and
despatch."2 Two years later, inspectors and deputy-inspectors of
hospitals were created, who assumed the administrative functions
of the hospital or army medical board. Subsequently, in 1810,
a director-general was appointed.3 Before the late war with
Russia there were in the English army :—
Inspectors-general of hospitals ... 5
Deputy inspectors-general ... 8
Staff surgeons, 1st class . . . . 31
Staff surgeons, 2nd class .... 49
Staff assistant surgeons .... 83
Apothecaries ...... 4
Dispensers ...... 0
Regimental surgeons .... 140
Regimental assistant surgeons . . . 2264
Since that war a few changes have been made in this return,
but they are non-essential.
The regimental surgeons have been subordinated to the staff
surgeons ; while all have been subject to the orders of the
principal medical officer ; who has detailed, as occasion seemed

<pb>
to require, the subordinate officers to the various duties con-
nected with the general service—such as the giving of first
relief, the superintendence of transportation, or executive or
administrative work in the brigade, division or general hos-
pitals. Thus, for more than a hundred years, the medical
service in the English army has been directed by medical officers,
and since a time almost equally remote, the expenses incurred
by the establishment and maintenance of army hospitals, have
been supported by the state, and not by the surgeons.
Fourthly: the condition of the hospitals has steadily improved,
as well from a clearer understanding of their just relations to an
army, as by the general diffusion of more enlightened views upon
sanitary subjects.
The regimental hospital has always, since the organization of
regiments, been a very important establishment in the English
army, and here a large part, often the largest part, of the soldiers
have been treated, whether for disease or wounds.1 It was,
however, to Sir John Pringle that the English service was prin-
cipally indebted for the system of treating the sick within the
regiment. Pringle had a great and wholesome fear of general
hospitals, and strenuously advocated the dispersion of the sick in
small establishments, and that, so far as possible, under the
direct superintendence of their own medical officers.
"Regimental hospitals," he observes, "are of the greatest
consequence . . . and regimental surgeons are to treat as
many as they can conveniently attend or accommodate in the
regimental hospitals. As for the general hospital, let it receive
such only as the regimental ones cannot conveniently contain,
and the sick that cannot be moved with the army." 2
Says Sir James MacGrigor, in his account of the Peninsular
campaigns :—" The divisions of the army composed of from eight
to fifteen or sixteen regiments, under the command of a lieu-
1 According to Sir James Macgrigor, in the Peninsula, between the 21st of
December, 1811, and the 20th of June, 1814, 163,803 soldiers were admitted into
the general hospitals, and 176,067 into the regimental hospitals.—"Sir James
Macgrigor on Diseases of the Army"—Medico-Chirurg-ical Transactions, vol. vi.
p. 478.
* Pringle, " Observations," p. 107 et passim.
<pb>
tenant-general, were each of them under the medical superin-
tendence of an inspectorial officer, to whom the surgeons reported
and who regulated all the medical concerns of the division. It
was his duty to see that, however short a time a batallion or
corps rested in one place, a regimental hospital was established,
indeed, as they carried with them medicines, bedding, stores, and
all the materials of a hospital, a regiment might be said to have
its hospital constantly established even on the march. It was
frequently established in the face of an enemy, and nearly within
reach of his guns. When a regiment halted, after getting the
men under cover in some building, and constructing chimneys,
the first object was to make bedsteads, getting at the same time
additional mattresses of straw, rushes, &c. It was really sur-
prising to see with what rapidity this was done; so much were
regiments in the habit of it, that latterly I found the hospitals
complete in everything, and the men most comfortably lodged in
a few days after a regiment had halted. In short, by making
every corps constantly keep up an establishment for itself, we
could prevent the general hospitals being crowded; much severe
and acute disease was treated in its early and only curable stage,
and no slight wounds or ailments were sent off from the regi-
ments, by which means the effective force of the army was kept
up, or perhaps increased by several thousand men." 1
The motives which induced Pringle and MacGrigor, to advo-
cate the establishment and maintenance of regimental hospitals,
have equally influenced the opinions of a large part of the
officers, who have since had charge of the health service in the
English army. The regimental hospital has always been in-
tended, however, for the sick rather than the wounded, as also
for the treatment of mild rather than severe cases.2 For the
care of the latter, general hospitals were created. Of these,
Pringle says, there "are two kinds, viz: the flying hospital
attending the camps at some convenient distance, and the
1 "Medico-Chi. Trans." vol. vi. pp. 475-476.
! Macgrigor states that of the 176,067 soldiers treated in the regimental hospitals
in the Peninsula, 3,841 died, while of the 163,803 treated in the general hospitals
14,672 died. Ibid. p. 478.
M
<pb>
stationary hospital which is fixed to one place." 1 The flying
hospitals were generally attached to divisions, or special corps
and like the regimental hospitals were for the sick rather than
the wounded.
To meet the requirements of the wounded, special hospitals have
been created under the direction of the principal medical officers.
These hospitals have sometimes been intended to serve the whole
army, although commonly they have been created for each division
or brigade, and have accordingly been placed under the immediate
direction of the respective division or brigade staff-surgeons.
Millingen, who served in the Peninsular war, commends the
following dispositions for the field service, which are substantially
not only those accepted at the close of the last century, but are
also those at the present time generally observed in the English
army.2
"Staff-surgeons of brigade will minutely inspect the field equip-
ment of the regimental medical officers under their orders, &c.
"In the rear of each brigade, and within range of musketry,
will be stationed a proportion of the hospital corps with their
bearers ready mounted, and their canteens filled with water.
They will be under the medical direction of an assistant surgeon,
one being selected for this duty in every brigade. This officer
will not delay the wounded for the purpose of dressing them,
but merely check any alarming hemorrhage, and accelerate their
removal to the rear ....
"The drummers and pioneers of regiments, that can be
spared, will assist the wounded from the ranks to this first
station ....
"In the rear of the first line of assistance, and out of the
range of musketry, should be established the brigade hospitals
.... These hospitals should be attended by the surgeons of
regiments and their assistants, and when practicable be formed
under cover. Here will be assembled the spring-waggons, long
cars, and surgeons' bat-horses, the wounded be dressed, cases

Hennen, "Observations." Edinburgh, 1818, pp. 28-29.
<pb>
requiring immediate operation attended to, the transports loaded,
directed to the divisional hospitals, and the bearers immediately
sent back to the first line.
"In the rear of the centre of each division will be established
a divisional hospital, out of the range of artillery. These 'will be
attended by the staff-surgeons of brigade and their assistants.
Here the wounded will be operated upon, and assembled for the
time being." From thence, however, he directs that all cases that
can be moved, are to be sent off, as soon as possible, to the general
receiving hospitals, which it is presumed have been opened at
some base, still farther in the rear; while those who cannot
safely be removed, are to be made "as comfortable as circum-
stances permit" at the field division hospital.1
The ambulance, in the sense of a special organization for the
care of the wounded in the field, has had no existence in the
English army. Field work has usually been done by details
of regimental and staff-surgeons, selected for each occasion;
while the stretcher bearers and hospital attendants have likewise
commonly been detailed from the ranks, accordingly as there
seemed to be a necessity for their services. "At the close of
the last century, when troops were on active service, if a man
fell wounded, the officer commanding his company, ordered one
or two of his comrades to take care of him to the rear, or, if the
troops were actively engaged, he remained unheeded on the
ground until the fighting was over. It was not only in the field
that no regularly trained men were provided, for meeting the wants
of disabled soldiers, but no special corps until recently existed,
for ministering to the wants of the sick or wounded, or for assist-
ing the surgeon in attending upon them, even in the stationary
military hospitals; the only plan was for a certain proportion of
soldiers from the ranks to be sent as occasion might require, to
act as attendants upon the sick." 2
Indeed, the principal defect of the English organization, ap-

tor-General T. Longmore, p. 33.
<pb>
pears to have existed in the transport service ; while the absence
of a trained corps of hospital nurses, has also, not unfrequently,
been seriously felt; it would have been even more so, had not
the details for hospital work been made from among regularly
enlisted men. And I may take this occasion to observe, that one
of the faults of the French ambulance has arisen from the cir-
cumstance that the infermiers have often been men not regularly
enlisted in the army, and who in case of a neglect of duty, could
only be fined or expelled from the service.
If English armies have been unprovided with ambulances,
whose functions were similar to those attached to French corps,
they have usually possessed a hospital service, perhaps not less
important, but which has obtained a comparatively small develop-
ment in the French army—I refer to that represented by the
convalescent hospital.1 This is an establishment to which have
been sent, from both regimental and general hospitals, all those
persons so far recovered from disease or wounds as to no longer
require constant medical or surgical attention. The active hos-
pitals of all classes have thus been relieved, and the more rapid
recovery of the patient assured.
In this brief account I have shown, perhaps with sufficient clear-
ness, the general system in accordance with which the medical field
service has been conducted in the English army in modern times.
In the United States army, the medical department has been or-
ganized and conducted after the English plan. The hospitals bear-
ing the same names, have the same relations to each other, and
have been directed by a similar administration. The work of the
French ambulances volantes has also been done in the United States
army by special details of surgeons, organized by the "Medical
Director" as the occasion seemed to require. The experience,
however, of the war of the Rebellion, by exposing the defects of
a system which drew from the ranks, for each occasion, stretcher-
bearers and hospital attendants, led to the formation of special
"Ambulance corps" for field and hospital work. These corps dif-
fered somewhat, for a time, in the several armies; but on the 11th
1 The French depot de convalescent is by no means the equivalent of the English
or the American convalescent hospital.
<pb>
of March 1864, Congress passed "An Act to establish a uniform
system of ambulances in the armies of the United States." The
character of the system is shown in the first two sections of
the Act.
"Sec. I. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled:
That the medical director, or chief medical officer of each army
corps shall, under the control of the medical director of the
army to which such army corps belongs, have the direction and
supervision of all ambulances (waggons), medicine and other
waggons, horses, mules, harness, and other fixtures appertaining
thereto, and of all officers and men who may be detailed or
employed to assist him in the management thereof, in the army
corps in which he may be serving.
"Sec. II. And be it further enacted, That the commanding
officer of each army corps shall detail officers and enlisted men
for service in the ambulance corps of such army corps, upon the
following basis, viz.: one captain who shall be commandant of
said ambulance corps; one first lieutenant for each division in
such army corps; one sergeant for each regiment in such army
corps; three privates for each ambulance (waggon), and one
private for each waggon (medicine or other)."
As by the terms of the same Act, three ambulance waggons
were "allowed and furnished to each regiment of infantry of
500 men or more," the regimental ambulance corps consists
of nine privates and a sergeant.
Comparing the several organizations for the administration of
the health service, which I have had occasion to notice, I may
observe, that in England and the United States, the army health
service forms a free and independent department of the war
office. In France, this service has been a mere adjunct of a de-
partment, which unites under one control, everything connected
with the subsistence, clothing, pay, &c., of an army. Again, in
looking over the almost innumerable "Reglements sur le service
des hopitaux militaires," which have been issued in France
since 1747, one cannot fail to be impressed with the exactitude
with which the functions of this service have been defined; no
detail seems to have been so small as to have been overlooked,
<pb>
no possible contingency to have been unanticipated—a law has
been laid down for everything. On the other hand, the regula-
tions of the English and American army medical service have
entered comparatively seldom into administrative details, these
having commonly been left to be determined by circumstances,
and particularly, by the intelligent judgment of the officers who
were immediately responsible for the efficiency of the service.
The great object in England and the United States seems to
have been to secure an efficient administration. The great
object in France appears to have been to secure an economical
administration. The English system has been reproached, in
France, as one encouraging extravagant outlays, as one which from
an absence of control leaves a door open to peculation, &c. The
English system is certainly much more costly than the French;
not so much, however, because surgeons as a class are less
honest than quarter-masters, as because, in France, hospital
stores have been issued in accordance with a system of rationing,
which would appear to be the legacy of some siege or famine,
rather than the normal supply schedule of a well-provisioned
army. Indeed, the mania for saving has been carried to such
an extent, as to pretty nearly stop all movement.1
Hampered, also, as it has been by endless clerical forms,
checks, and contrdles, which repress all individual initiative as
well as destroy all sense of personal responsibility, it is question-
able if the French system does not so completely fail,—is not so
entirely impracticable—as to defeat its own object—as to be ex-
travagantly costly, however modest the estimate which appears
in the annual budget.
On the 4th of January, 1871, the French minister of war, then
at Tours, issued a decree, and with the following preamble:—
"Whereas the multitude of private ambulance corps in our armies,
1 The first question asked in France, whenever an administrative reform is pro-
posed, is, Et le prix? and if the first cost of the system proposed involves a centimfi
of additional expenditure, the custom has been to condemn it as impossible—and that
quite without reference to any gain of power, or even to any saving which ulti-
mately might be secured by the use of more perfect machinery. The additional cost
has, almost uniformly, been considered as a reality which was more than an offset, to
gains which were only theoretical.
<pb>
outside of the superintendence and control of the military autho-
rity, is calculated to lead to grave abuses, and it is possible to
prevent them, by causing these corps to be represented by a single
society duly qualified; and whereas, important services have
been rendered to the cause of humanity, by the ' Societe Interna-
tionale de secours aux blesses des armees de terre et de mer '—It
is decreed:
"Article 1. All the volunteer field ambulance corps, and other
societies, having in view the care of the wounded on the field of
battle after the conflict, are henceforth placed under the direc-
tion and the responsibility of the International Society for
aiding the wounded, which accepts the obligation and charges
resulting from this commission. . . .
"Article 2. The field ambulances corps, French or foreign, once
accepted, shall be subject to the orders of the general and of the
chief intendant of the army, who in concert with the general dele-
gate (of the " Societe- de Secours aux Blesses ") at the War Depart-
ment, shall assign them the places where their services may be
required. . . .
"Article 9. The minister of war shall have the right of nomina-
ting, with the assent of the Society, the delegate who shall repre-
sent it at the War Department." . . .
It is not my purpose to criticise the terms of this decree. I
wish here only to say, that the provisions of the decree were
most necessary under the circumstances existing, and, that it
has, I trust, initiated a much-needed reform. I say designedly
"initiated," for it only announces a beginning. It has permitted
the ambulances to be represented in the council of the administra-
tion, that is to say, the field hospital service is not by virtue of
this decree, subject to the sole and absolute control of the inten-
dance or quarter-master's department. Those most directly con-
cerned and responsible for the care of the wounded, are not only
to be consulted as to the disposition of the field hospital corps,
and the organization of hospitals, whether ambulant or sedentary,
but the general and chief quarter-master are to act in concert with
the officer representing them.
In one respect, the organization of the health service in the
armies of Great Britain and the United States, has differed
<pb>
radically from that which has hitherto found favour in France.
English and American medical officers have long been compara-
tively independent, as much so, perhaps, as the officers of any
special corps in the army. They have been subject only to the
general orders of the military officer commanding the post, or the
force to which they may have been attached,—they have had the
full direction—so far as is possible in a military organization
—each one of his own service, and have been held directly
and personally responsible for the proper and efficient conduct
of the same. Of the hospital, once established, whether regi-
mental, brigade, division, or general, the American army surgeon
is not simply the administrator, but he is the commanding officer
in the most absolute military sense of the expression; while the
whole hospital service of the army is under the direction of the
surgeon-general, who is immediately responsible solely to the
Secretary of War.
The medical service in all armies, has always been, and will
always be, greatly dependent upon the quarter-master's depart-
ment. It is this department which moves its material, and
furnishes the means for transporting the sick. It is this depart-
ment which provides the medical service with the necessary shelter,
as also with much of the material indispensable to its efficiency
and even existence. But the extent to which the Service de Sante
in the French army has been and still is subordinated to the
Intendance or Quarter-master's department, is quite incredible.
It may not be unprofitable to state in this connection, specifically,
some of the relations of the Service de Sante to the Intendance.
It may prepare the way for a clearer understanding of the causes
which led to the creation of an organization, to which I have
already alluded, and which during the late war played no incon-
siderable role in the direction of the French health service.
The functions of the Officiers de sante en chef, in relation to the
Intendant, are thus officially defined:—" The chief health-officers
attend the chief Intendant on the field, they execute all the
missions with which he charges them, are consulted by him as to
the salubrity of the places to be converted into hospital estab-
lishments, and report to him on everything concerning the service
under whatsoever head it may come.
<pb>
"Every order which they give is to be submitted to the chief
Intendant."1
If it is a question of the duties to be discharged during an
action, the regulation establishes at length, and with precision,
those of the officer of administration—an intendant—charged
with the affairs of the ambulance ; he is nominally responsible
even for the service of the barley-water and the catnip tea.
The regulation also shows how these officers of administration,
the head-nurses, and stretcher-bearers, are placed in the rear
with the stretchers to pick up the wounded; "it gives in detail
what the officer of administration, chief of the ambulance, is to
do in order to insure a speedy evacuation of the wounded on to
the neighbouring hospitals; it goes even into such minutiae as to
point out the precautions which this same officer should take in
burying the dead in certain soils. This part of the regulations
has anticipated everything, there is but one thing wanting, the
health-officers are not even named." 1
In the ordonnance on the general organization of the army and
its staff, issued May 3rd, 1832, there is no mention made either
of the chief medical officers of the army, or of their subordi-
nates, nor is there even an allusion made, either directly or in-
directly, to the Health Department, in the detailed index at the
end of the ordonnance. In accordance with this ordonnance, "all
the employes and details connected with the administration,"
were subjected to the control of the agents of the intendance,
that under their immediate orders the execution of the different
services connected with the administration might be assured.
"In the event of a siege, the chief of staff is to take mea-
sures with the quarter-master (l'intendant), that means are
organized for the transportation and care of the wounded,
and should stretcher-bearers and nurses be wanting in the army,
they will be taken from among the inhabitants."3 It will be
seen that by the first passage, which I have quoted, the medical
1 "Reglement General du ler Avril, 1831." Titre xi.-cii. sec. ii. arts. 1063,
1064.
* Begin, op. cit. p. 290.
5 "Ordonnance du 3 Mai, 1832," arts. 12 and 209.
<pb>
officers are classed with "all the employes," and subordinated
to the control of any acting quarter-master, while in the second
paragraph they are altogether ignored. Nor is this all, in the
136th article of the ordonnance, the duties of quarter-masters,
and under quarter-masters are specified as follows :—"The
quarter masters (les intendants), and under quarter-masters
(sous-intendants), are responsible for the Health Department.
They are charged with the bringing together of the means of
assistance and transport for the wounded. Before and after the
action they should be occupied with these important duties; they
are to report to the general officer^." In fact, the French army-
surgcon is entirely under the control of the chief quarter-master
of the column or hospital to which he may be attached. This
official is the judge of the surgeon's professional skill, and assigns
him to any special duty he may choose. In matters concerning
camp hygiene, it is he who decides as to the value of this or that
sanitary measure. Every hospital is administered by a sous-
intendant, or officier d'administration comptable, an officer of a
minor grade; he directs everything; the surgeon, whatever his
rank, is not able even to punish a nurse for a neglect of duty;
the case must be brought before this quarter-master.
Moreover, the diet list and the medicines to be employed,
are strictly limited to certain formulas. For example, hospital
surgeons are forbidden to serve more than five cutlets, on any
one day, in a ward of fifty sick, no matter what their condition;
and it is said that M. Leuret, a medical officer of high rank, was
compelled at the close of the Italian campaign, to pay to the
Government 1,500 francs for the supplementary cutlets he had
served to his patients; while M. Lacronique, a medical officer
of equal rank, was found in debt to the Government 84 francs
for omelettes not provided for in the regulations.1 There is no
such thing as prescribing at the bed of the patient. Formulas
have been prepared, anticipating all possible complications, and
to these the physician must limit himself. The rule is absolute.2

<pb>
These formularies enter into the minutest details, and inform the
physician to whom sugar and water may be given, and to whom
it shall not be given.1
Not only is the army physician bound by such restrictions, but
the autocratic assumptions of the intendance, and the power
which it possesses, even as regards his personal independence, are
almost incredible. Says M. Le Fort:—" While I was at Milan
in 1859, the chief physician of the hospitals of that city, M. Cu-
veiller, now inspector of the Service de Sante, thought it to be his
duty to write a letter of thanks to the physicians of the city who
had assisted us in taking care of the wounded. One morning all
the army physicians in Milan were summoned to meet at the
hospital San Ambrogio, the sub-assistants included, of whom I
was one, and, doubtless, that the glory of the intendance might •
be the better established, the Italian civil physicians attached to
the various hospitals. The object of the meeting was soon
explained. The sous-intendant, De Lavalette, came forward and
began to read a letter, commencing in terms nearly as follows:—
'An army physician has thought he could address a circular'—
'I beg pardon,' replied our eminent confrere, 'that letter written
by me is not a circular.' 'You shall have fifteen days' arrest for
that observation.'1 Such was the reply of Monsieur le Sous-
intendant." 2
It is scarcely surprising that, crushed by such despotic restric-
tions and assumptions, the Regular Medical Department of the
French army should have had, at the outbreak of the recent war,
neither the ability nor the courage to assume to provide for the
multitude of sick and wounded, which it was certain would have
to be taken care of during the campaign. The result was, that
before a blow had been struck, the Regular Medical Department
had so far resigned what might well be presumed to be its special
prerogative, as to leave to the "Societe de Secours aux Blesses,"
a civil society, the work of organizing nearly all the ambulance

<pb>
corps, intended to follow the moving columns of the army into the
field and assist in the active work of battle-field relief; as also to
resign to this same society, and kindred societies, and private
charity, the organization of most of the sedentary hospitals which
it might become necessary to establish in the towns and cities of
France. Not only have these civil associations and private indi-
viduals, sent into the field ambulance corps and organized local
hospitals, but they have supported nearly all the expenses incident
to such establishments. The salaries of the surgeons, and the
wages of the nurses, the cost of the material necessary, houses,
hospital furniture, waggons, horses, medicines—even the food, of
the sick and wounded treated in these hospitals—all these have
been furnished largely, if not principally, by private charity.1
. It will be seen from this statement, that during the recent war,
the role of the French Sanitary Associations was not that of
supplementing any existing military service; so far as they acted
they supplanted, not only the Medical Department, but the
Government itself; they supplanted the Medical Department
completely, and the Government,—to speak exactly I should
perhaps say the Intendance—to this extent, that just in pro-
portion as it yielded to the demands made by private charity to
assist in taking care of the sick, it abandoned to such charity its
responsibility (to the public) for the care and treatment the sick
and wounded might receive.
A cause, which also powerfully contributed to this result, was
the absolute poverty of the regular service de sante, when in the
field, with regard to the material means for hospitalizing the sick.
No hospital establishments were especially created for it. "The
organization of the regular medical service in the French army
stops at the ambulance of head-quarters "2—a field hospital estab-
lished in the most accessible churches, houses, or barns. If this
is unable to receive the wounded, on account of their numbers,
they are sent back to the first towns, and thrown in upon the
civil hospitals, or, these not existing, are placed in such buildings

as can be used temporarily as hospitals. Such hospitals as Eng-
lish and American General Hospitals, and the Prussian Etappen
Lazareth Hospitals, regularly organized at important points behind
active armies, provisionally created to afford relief to the field
hospitals, and to obviate the necessity of distant and rapid trans-
portations, are unknown in the French service. The sedentary
hospitals, the so-called hospitals of the second and third line, are
always established in public or private buildings, hastily appropri-
ated to the purpose. In speaking of them, M. Michel LeVy says:—
"Indeed, it is a piece of good fortune when one can, as in Italy,
count upon a vast group of richly furnished establishments, civil
hospitals and asylums, convents and palaces, scattered through a
series of great cities and rich towns, united by railways," &C.1
It will be understood, therefore, that when voluntary associa-
tions had opened sedentary hospitals—" ambulances "—in all the
principal cities and towns of France, those nearest to the field of
action, or on the lines of evacuation from it, were eagerly accepted
by officers who, burdened with convoys of wounded, were often
utterly ignorant as to where they were to be placed, and were
thankful for the first opportunity to relieve themselves from a
heavy charge, and an irksome responsibility.
I have said, that the admission of a delegate from the "Societe de
Secours aux Blesses" to the councils of the administration, initiated
a reform ; it certainly did, it was a blow struck at an old ty-
ranny. But, as might have been inferred, the evils incident to
the system, or rather want of system, which grew out of this
arrangement were immense.
In the first place, the "Societe de Secours aux BlesseV' possessed
no special qualifications for the direction of the ambulance service
of an army. In fact, it was thoroughly incompetent. Founded
in 1864, nominally to assist in taking care of the wounded of
armies, always feeble in numbers — without funds—unrecog-
nized officially—it was sleeping in a cataleptic repose when the
declaration of war in July, 1870, like a sudden peal of thunder,
startled all France. The council of this society was composed
when the war broke out, of a body of gentlemen, with a single
1 "Traite d'Hygiene." Paris, 1869; tome ii. p. 542.
<pb>
exception, wholly unacquainted with military life and the
machinery which moves an army, and this exception was a
medical gentleman, who moreover was the only person in the
council whose name was possessed of any scientific reputation
whatsoever. The council had had no experience of any kind,
had projected no plans, and for the simple reason that it had
no clear ideas of its own mission.
But war had been declared, and it was necessary that some-
thing should be done. The society, accordingly, offered its ser-
vices to the Government; it offered to take care of the wounded,
and also at the same time to furnish for that purpose its own
surgeons, nurses, waggons, and hospitals; it thus volunteered to
assume at once the functions of a department.
These offers were vaguely accepted by the French Government,
and the Society immediately began to organize and send off its
ambulances.
Coming into the field as a volunteer organization, forming no
essential part of the military hierarchy, largely ignored by the
intendance—whose prerogatives it had encroached upon, but upon
whom it was necessarily dependent, not only for its information,
but for its means of moving, and even of existing—the efficiency
of the society was immediately paralyzed by the abnormal and
false position it occupied. It was almost constantly ignorant of
the necessities of the several armies in the field; it, at least
for a long time, neither possessed nor could furnish any exact
information on those very subjects, a knowledge of which was
most essential before any intelligent executive measures could
be adopted. Even the position of the different corps and
divisions, as well as the means of reaching such sections of the
army, was unknown to it. Ambulances were sent off one after
the other to grope their way3 as they might, to the corps to which
they had been assigned, or to hunt up some special field of use-
fulness. Everything was done in the dark, and while the majority
of the ambidances were wandering about the country, signal
services were rendered only by the few which blundered into
usefulness.
"On the 27th of August, the eighth ambulance left the Palace
of Industry, about three o'clock in the afternoon, and took the
<pb>
train at the Northern station, about ten o'clock in the evening.
It was to go by way of Hirson to Mezieres, and thence join
as it could—comme elle pourrait—the corps of General Felix
Douai.
"No one had, in fact, any information as to the position
occupied by that general; it was only known that he had left
Belfort to rejoin Marshal MacMahon, who was himself, probably,
on his way to Metz, where Marshal Bazaine had been shut in." 1
And as this ambulance left Paris, so they all left, although
they did not all find their way back again, as this one did, a fort-
night after, and only to there repeat its first experience.
"September 10th, 11th. After a day of rest at Paris, the
ambulance, anxious as it was to be at its post, received the order
to go to Lagny. We were told, that in the direction of Meaux
there was a French corp d'armee, and that there, certainly, we
should find an occasion for being useful. We arrived rapidly at
Lagny by train, and assured ourselves personally that it was
impossible that any engagement could have taken place. There
was scarcely even a mobile or a scout in the country.
"September 12th, 13th. Our Lagny campaign was not a
brilliant one; the ambulance, impatient to do something, has re-
ceived the order to go to Villeneuve Saint Georges.
"It was thought, that there would be an engagement in that
direction. The Lyons road being cut, we took the Orleans road
as far as Juvisy. We were able to assure ourselves that the
absence of French troops was as complete on this side as on
that of Lagny." 2
Says M. Le Fort, in his account of the first ambulance:—" The
4th of August had been fixed as the day of our departure.
Nancy was to be our first halting place ; this destination had
been indicated to us by an order from the imjierial head-quarters.
What had passed was substantially this: our situation in the
army was very badly defined. The ambulances of the society, as
well as the society itself, pretended to be independent, and not
to receive their orders from the administration, that is to say from
1 "8me Ambulance de Campagne de la Societe de Secours aux Blesses." Rapport
par M. Amedee Tardieu. Paris, 1872; p. 5. 4 Ibid. pp. 16-17.
<pb>
the intendance. This was equivalent to a resolution from the
very beginning, never to be seasonably informed of the military
movements of the army. To avoid as much as possible such an
inconvenience the understanding was, that M. Conneau, the
Emperor's surgeon, should be our intermediary at head-quarters,
our guide, our counsellor, and if it was necessary our chief and
our protector. Doctor Anger, associated with Doctor Conneau,
was to transmit to us the opinions and the orders of our eminent
confrere. At the time of our leaving Paris, the army was scat-
tered all along the frontier; to what place should the ambulance
go, to what corps should it by preference be attached ?—this was
the problem to be solved. M. Nelaton had gone to Metz, and
after having held a conference at head-quarters with M. M. Larrey,
Conneau, and Wolf, intendant-general, it was decided that we
should go to Nancy and await the army there. . . . Sunday
passed and not a single wounded man arrived at Nancy. . . .
Our situation became more and more embarrassing. On the 7th
of August, in the evening I directed M. Couttolenc to proceed to
Metz, and demand instructions from Dr. Conneau. This under-
taking was utterly fruitless, I was unable to obtain advice, even
that which was unofficial. In fact, it would perhaps have been
difficult to have answered my request, for no one then knew, when
disasters at every instant were being reported, what direction
might be given to the army. I was therefore left to my own
initiative as also to my perplexities, and they were great, since I
had to divine, in some sort, events from reports which were con-
tradicted at every instant." 1 M. Le Fort finally concluded to go on
to Metz. The society after having sent the ambulance to Nancy,
had nothing more to do with it, until after the surrender of Metz,
when the ambulance was disbanded.
The second ambulance, under the direction of M. See\ left
Paris on the 11th of August with the order to go to Metz ; on
arriving at Frouard, it was found that the railway was cut; after
wandering about in a vain attempt to reach Metz by another
route, it strayed within the German lines, where the personnel
1 "La Chirurgie Militaire." Appendice, p. 33, et seq.
<pb>
were made prisoners, and from whence they were sent back to
France, by way of Coblentz and Belgium, ten days later.
The third ambulance was also captured a few days after it left
Paris. Says the surgeon of the sixth ambulance :—" Without in-
structions, without control, our ambulances whether attached to
army corps or free, wandered about at hazard, and the services
which they rendered were due principally to the initiative, the
talent, and the courage of the chief surgeons who directed them." 1
The story of the Odyssey of each of these ambulances is nearly
the same; with the exception of the sixth ambulance, which did
succeed in finding MacMahon's head-quarters, which it had re-
ceived orders to join, of the twelve or thirteen ambulances
sent out from Paris by the "Societe de Secours aux Blesses,"
scarcely one ever reached either the corps or the place to which
it was ordered.
By the assumption of this Society to direct the field ambulance
service, the regular medical officers of the army were to a great
degree not only relieved of their proper responsibilities, but many
of them were practically deposed and left either in idleness or to
the uneventful office of prescribing for the daily ailments of the
troops. There was no uniformity in either the special or general
treatment which the sick received—this varied as the opinion of
the surgeon-in-chief, and as the liberalities at the disposition of
the ambulance. Irregularities of every sort were inevitable in
such a hospital organization ; neither medical officers nor attend-
ants could be held to any fixed term of service, or punished for
any neglect of duty not in itself criminal. The nurses, generally
recruited among the most worthless portion of the population,
too poorly paid to be controlled by considerations of profit, and
outside of civil as well as military discipline, could be depended
upon for nothing.
The records of the hospitals thus established so varied in their
details as to be quite incomparable ; their completeness and even
accuracy depending upon the fidelity and scientific habits of
thinking, personal to the surgeon in charge. Another evil ex-

isted, viz., the impossibility of ascertaining the exact number
of available beds in any city or department ; frequently, no one
knew how many men it would do to send to a certain city or
even ambulance. Nor was this the only unfortunate result of not
knowing what hospital accommodations might have already been
provided; ambulances (sedentary hospitals) were needlessly
multiplied as well as frequently established in places where they
could render no service. Indeed, the feverish zeal with which
school-houses, convents, and public and private buildings were
converted into ambulances, without reference to those already
organized, was such, that a ministerial circular, issued for the
purpose of moderating this excessive activity, had little effect.
"I saw," says a surgeon, "on the 18th of February—that is to
say during the armistice and just before the conclusion of peace
—a requisition, that had been sent to a convent, which it was
proposed to seize for the purpose of converting it into a hospital,
and this at a time when, in the town, there were more than 150
vacant beds, and when, in the neighbourhood, there was no accu-
mulation of troops which might lead one to anticipate any new
necessities." 1
The number of available beds in a department was moreover
constantly liable to be over estimated, from the extent to which
the red-cross flag and the word ambulance were used for no other
purpose than as a protection to property.2
The selfish motives, which prompted the opening of ambu-
lances, were often revealed in places where they were to have
been least expected. Says M. Tardieu:—" At the time of our
arrival, two Dominicans alone remained in their establishment;
the reception they gave us was most cordial. We were to finally
learn that interest counted for much in this reception, and that
1 "Malades et Blesses de l'Armee de la Loire." Rapport au Ministere par T.
Gallard, 1871.
! In accordance with the 5th Article of the Treaty of Geneva:—
- "The inhabitants of the country, as well as the members of the volunteer
ambulance corps, who shall give aid to the wounded, shall be respected and
protected.
"Any wounded soldier received and taken care of in a house shall be for it a
safeguard."
<pb>
very frequently, during this sad war, the international flag has
been desired rather as a protection to property than as the mark
of a friendly refuge for the unfortunate wounded. . . . We
received at the same time the offers of service of the sisters of
Cachan. . . . Alas! the relations, which we had at first, with
these sisters, were as excellent as those which we had had with the
monks. Our ambulance learned to find out later that convents
are not entered with impunity." 1
Few saw during the war a private ambulance opened for the .
sick, nearly all were for the wounded. For the vast multitude of
sick little popular interest was shown. The sick soldier was left
by the wayside, while often a crowd of zealous philanthropists,
impelled by a love of dramatic effect, gathered around the
wounded man, and contended among themselves for his possession.
"All Paris remembers . . . the long line of carriages of every
form and hue which used to go out as far as the ramparts, or a
little farther, and then return in triumph when they had found a
wounded man,—for there was a time, when it was a la mode in Paris
to have our wounded man. A sick soldier! No. It must be one
wounded, and above all, lightly wounded—in the arm, for ex-
ample. What a sad sight such an abuse. How much power—
how much admirable devotion came to nothing, by reason of pre-
tenders of every sort, coming from no one knew where, who
paralyzed everything by their contact ?"2
Every little coterie was ambitious to have its ambulance, which
it could direct and talk about. Hospitals had their "lady
managers," whose sole qualifications were rank, wealth, and the
unconquerable determination to keep at the head of fashion,
through whatever singular paths it might lead. In these private
establishments "the doctor" often played only an inconsider-
able role. He did what he was told to do; he was obedient and
submissive; he was necessary—and so was the scullion.3

1 While during the late war the regular medical service, in the German armies,
retained in the field a large portion of its just independence in matters of adminis-
tration, it seems to have exercised very little, if any, control over most of the
general hospitals, opened in Germany, for the sick and wounded returned from
the front. Large numbers of these hospitals were essentially civil foundations,
<pb>
The very name which the chief French Volunteer Society
assumed—" Societe de Secours aux Blesses "—was unfortunate, as
it tended to create and direct popular sympathy and charity for the
victims of war, almost wholly in the direction where there was
really least occasion for it. The sick were forgotten, the pri-
soners were forgotten, and most of the suffering special to sieges
and a war of invasion, except that resulting from wounds, which
in comparison was trifling.
The sketch which I have given of the operation of a volunteer
ambulance system, is certainly not a pleasing one. For many
reasons I wish I could have stated the case differently. To have
done so would have been impossible. The evidence of the com-
plete inefficiency of the volunteer system as applied in France,
during the late war, is irrefutable, and the most remarkable cir-
cumstance is, that this evidence is supported by the statements,
and nearly unanimous conclusions of those surgeons who had the
direction of volunteer ambulances. If M. Le Fort, of the first
ambulance says:—." The experiment which has been tried by the
international society has proved a complete failure"1 — so M.
Championniere of the fifth ambulance, concludes as follows:—" I
might endeavour to show the improvements of various kinds of
which the volunteer ambulance corps are susceptible. I shall,
however, not go into these details, as I believe that civil ambu-
lances, so far as battle fields are concerned, have played their
role, and that this rdle is finished." While M. Piotrowski of the
sixth ambulance, a member of the Council of the French Society,
affirms as the result of his experience, that " the sanitary service of
the army should have an organization wholly military, and in no
way civil, especially upon the battle-field." 2
Indeed, I might multiply almost indefinitely these results and
conclusions after a bitter and sad experience.
One inference, from the facts just stated, must be, that the dis-
created, as were the French ambulances, by "Societes de Secours," or private
individuals; they were very generally directed by committees of ladies, and the
doctors and surgeons appear to have been, almost without exception, the most insig-
nificant appendages of the establishments.

<pb>
order in the administration of the health service of the French
army in 1870-71 was complete; such an inference would be
just. Another inference may be drawn, that the "Soci&e de
Secours aux BlesseV' was principally and immediately respon-
sible for this disorder; such an inference would be unjust. The
"Societe de Secours aux Blesses," I presume, always did as
well as it could, and unquestionably quite as much as any similar
society could have done, had it assumed the same position. At
least, the administration of the society always appeared to be
anxious to do what it could, and all it could, to accomplish the
overt objects of its mission; and numberless instances of the
most heroic devotion on the part of its agents might be mentioned.
The real cause of the confusion was the introduction into the
administration of the army of an irresponsible agency, whose
active functions were wholly undefined; and the responsibility for
the consequences which followed, properly belongs to those who
first accepted it, and subsequently permitted it.
Whatever the blame, however, which may be attached to those
persons, the excuses which may be offered in their justification
are many. The inefficiency of the regular service de sante was
notorious—the principal cause, unfortunately, had not been
equally so. Having emasculated this service by depriving it of
authority until it was to the last degree impotent, and that by
the confessions of the most eminent men in the service,—it was
too late, after war had been declared, to discuss reforms in its
administration. The horrors of the Crimea, of Magenta, and
Solferino, the French people did not care to see repeated—nor
did the Government either, if there was a possibility of avoiding
them. The proposition made by the representatives of popular
charity to take care of the wounded, and provide for all their
wants without embarrassment, as also without cost to the Govern-
ment, was alike too magnificent and too generous to be hastily
rejected. Moreover the popular political effects of a general and
sympathetic movement on the part of the whole French nation in
behalf of the wounded of its armies could not be overlooked.
France needed in the struggle into which she had rashly thrown
herself all her strength—moral as well as physical—and thus, the
proposition of the "Societe de Secours aux Blesses" came to be
<pb>
accepted, although for a long time the action of the society was
tolerated rather than officially recognized.
The responsibility, however, for the general confusion in the
administration of the health service, which reigned under the Re-
public as well as under the Empire in the armies of France, must
still be assigned to those who, in time of peace, were strong
enough to strip of its just prerogatives an essential arm of
military service, and who in the presence of war were weak
enough to confer them upon the first claimant.
It is quite impossible to maintain the efficiency of any service
without a competent and responsible direction. The regular
service de sante in the French army is competent, but has never
been invested with the attributes of direction, and is consequently
responsible only for its competence. The " Societe de Secours aux
Blesses," on the plea of the inefficiency of the regular service—an
inefficiency most deplorably manifest—succeeded ultimately in
obtaining from the general administration a concession of several
important privileges—including a part of the right of direction—
which constantly claimed, have been as persistently withheld
from the regular service; while at the same time it evaded nearly
all administrative responsibility, on the ground of being an extra
official organization.
The French army hospital service was established, therefore)
during the late war, on substantially the following basis. The
regular service de sante retained its competence with such respon-
sibility as might be connected therewith, but, conscious of its
feebleness, consented to stand aloof. The Intendance retained its
responsibility (to itself), but transferred to the "Societe de Secours
aux BlesseV' a portion of its authority; as a special qualification
for the exercise of this authority, the "Society" combined some-
thing of the competence of the service de sante with something of
the authority of the intendance—and both, in about equally small
measures. When this triple repartition had been effected, the
organization, such as it was, was complete. It will be observed that
the " Societe " added no strength to it—it gave nothing—it took
everything it possessed—it took from the intendance its authority,
and from the service de sante its opportunity to act. The result
was inevitable—a more chaotic and wretched state of things
<pb>
could scarcely be imagined than that which followed this singular
division of attributes, the union of which, under one head, was
alike indispensable and imperative.
The name which is given to an Army Medical Department
is of little consequence; it may be called a "Sanitary Com-
mission," or a "Societe de Secours aux Blesses," or a
"Service de Sante," or by any other name; it must, however,
form an integral part of the machinery of the army, be repre-
sented by a single person, and be made directly responsible,
through that person, for all its acts to the chief of the War
Department.
Made officially responsible for its acts, the " Societe de Secours"
might have taken the place of the service de sante. With some-
thing of that liberty of action and administrative independence
which was conceded to the " Soci&e de Secours," the regular service
de sante would have left no place for the "Societe de Secours" in
any work of administration. Such being the position, the course
which should have been pursued is too evident for discussion.
There can be no place in any well regulated army for a volun-
teer health service. It is as anomalous a creation as would be
a volunteer ordnance department, or a volunteer commissariat;
and not one of the least remarkable, I might say astounding,
facts connected with the late war was the recognition of volun-
tary ambulance corps as constituent elements of active armies,
and that, by a Government presumed to be pre-eminently skilled
not only in matters of military art, but in the general science of
organization.
The French "Societe de Secours aux Blesses" completely mis-
took its own proper vocation. It misconceived, apparently wilfully,
the true province of voluntary effort in behalf of the sick and
wounded of armies; and a new field, once opened to it, seemed
even, at times, to be led on rather by an inordinate desire of
securing to itself official and popular power, and the brilliant
insignia of a new order of Hospitallers, than by a desire to fulfil
in the most effective manner the conscientious duties of charity
and citizenship.
Mr. Stills, the official historian of the United States' Sanitary
Commission, in stating the causes which led to the formation of
<pb>
that Commission—risks to which the soldier was exposed, the
apparent helplessness of the Government to provide adequate
remedies, &c., says: — "It was determined by some enlightened
men, most of whom had been taught by their profession the
value of preventative hygienic measures, to try the experiment of
infusing some of the popular enthusiasm and popular sympathy
into the cumbrous machinery of Government. This was to be
done not irregularly, or in the way of embarrassing intervention,
but strictly in aid of the Government plans; as far as possible,
through Government means, and wholly in subordination to the
great object which the Government had in view in prosecuting the
war. This was the germ, the original conception of the functions
of a Sanitary Commission . . . They were not disposed to supplant
the Government as the proper and most efficient care-taker of the
army, but simply so to mould the popular will that it should aid,
encourage, and uphold whatever was undertaken by the Govern-
ment in the direction of humane and careful guardianship of the
soldier . . . Into the untried future, with all its fearful dangers,
they hesitated to cast what might prove in practice an additional
element of confusion and embarrassment to an already sorely
pressed Government." 1
It was one of the glories of the United States' Sanitary Com-
mission that it never became a piece of political machinery; nor
did it ever propose to do any part of the work which the Govern-
ment had undertaken to do, better than the Government was
doing it. It only proposed to aid the Government—supplement
its deficiencies, and encourage it. It never attached to a division
or to an army corps a body of surgeons; it directed no hospital,
and it never owned even an ambulance waggon. It offered its
services whenever and wherever there seemed to be an occasion
for them, whether in camp, in the hospitals, or elsewhere; but
always in complete subordination to every department of the
military hierarchy. Whatever power it or its agents exercised was
simply moral power, which was all the more real and conspicuous,
free as the Commission was from even the suspicion of seeking

to attain objects of personal interest and ambition, by impeaching
the competence of any established bureau, or the capacity of any
person connected therewith.
In war there may be large and frequent opportunities for the
exercise of private charity and benevolence, but an unlimited
exercise of these sentiments must often be incompatible with the
public welfare, the welfare of the army, and with a wise humanity
itself. The army medical service has been created for the sole
purpose of giving succour to the sick and wounded ; if composed
of the proper personal elements, when clothed with sufficient
power, and provided with the necessary means, it would serve the
purpose of its creation as perfectly as is possible—certainly much
more perfectly than a heterogeneous society of civilians, foreign
to the army, slightly acquainted with its necessities, and uncon-
trolled by its discipline.
So much of the suffering incident to battle-fields as may have
been unnecessary, as might have been avoided, is not to be con-
sidered conclusive evidence, as superficial observers would have
us believe, of the necessity of organizing volunteer hospital corps
in time of war. It simply shows that the regular medical service
from some cause may have been unable to afford all the relief
necessary. This cause should be carefully sought, ascertained,
and removed. If it was obviously through some radical defect
in the organization of the service, the want of certain authority—
correct this defect, and accord the authority necessary;—was it
because sufficient material means may never have been furnished
by the central administration?—such means should be placed at
the disposition of the service;—was it because the service was
deficient in personal strength ?—increase the number of its
agents;—was it because of the personal incompetence of those
charged with the service ?—replace them by men who are able
to discharge its duties.
"Societes de Secours aux Blesses" have in principle, no raison
d'etre, while in practice, the "Societes de Secours" for which
there is the largest need, are au service de sante. This ser-
vice in certain armies needs help, that it may be rehabilitated
with the consideration and rights which naturally belong to
it, and may be invested with the authority necessary to its effi-
<pb>
ciency; while the regular medical service in all armies may be
aided with advantage by contributions of those material means
for taking care of the sick and wounded, which may be deficient
in the best equipped armies in great emergencies.
To assist the army medical service in the accomplishment of
its arduous and painful duty, to replenish its exhausted depots,
and aid it in the accomplishment of its task, as a servant, and at
the same time as a counsellor and a friend, and by so doing, to
convey to the wounded encouragement, and that sympathy which
the great heart of the nation feels for those who suffer in nobly
defending its honour, its soil, and its life—such should be the
mission of every volunteer association for the relief of the misery
of battle fields.
But there is another way in which a national voluntary asso-
ciation may powerfully contribute to the welfare of the army,—by
investigating and stimulating the investigation of sanitary laws,
as well as those inquiries which concern the most practical
methods of enforcing such laws in camps,—by determining the
relations of the soldier's food, clothing, shelter, and general and
special surroundings, to health and disease,—by ascertaining the
effects of different systems of hospitalization upon those suffering
from disease and wounds,—by devising improved systems of
transporting the sick,—by advocating such reforms in the general
organization of the army health service as may be required to
give to it greater efficiency,—by becoming, in short, the educator
and organ of that public opinion which, in every state, when
taught how to act, strips from individual men their arbitrary
personal power, and re-assumes its ancient and divine right of
sovereignty and control in every governmental service.
It was not my purpose in writing this report to present any
special criticisms concerning the personal and material organization
of the French army medical service in its several relations to the
regiment, the ambulance, and the hospital. It has seemed desir-
able, however, that the place held by this service in the military
hierarchy should be indicated, as also some of the general causes
which have partially paralyzed its force, as well in former cam-
paigns, as in that which has more recently closed.
<pb>
^»|gN the foregoing summary of the leading facts connected
j^HH with the history of the hospitalization of sick and
wounded soldiers, the general insufficiency of the means
used to protect armies against the ravages of diseases and the
losses consequent upon wounds received in battle is painfully
evident, although I have purposely avoided any special re-
ferences to the frightful results of official neglect, which
darken nearly every page of human history. Perhaps the
most remarkable fact is the absolute indifference with which
the fate of the sick and wounded was generally regarded, for
many centuries. When that indifference began to give place to
a more humane sentiment, the exercise of this sentiment was
for a long time practically obstructed by the conviction, that it
was useless to attempt to avoid the perils peculiar to war. This
conviction has manifested itself, everywhere, in a feeble and ineffi-
ciently organized sanitary service. The medical and surgical staff
has been numerically insufficient, and has rarely been invested
with those official attributes indispensable to an administrative
service. Medicines, surgical apparatus, clothing, and even food,
have seldom been provided with liberality; barely sufficient, even
in the uninstructed opinion of the time, where the necessity for
them was the least, when the want has been greatest, many of
these supplies have been absolutely unobtainable. Until the
middle of the eighteenth century, no organized service for the
transport of the wounded had ever been proposed in Europe,
and it is only a hundred years earlier that the first references
are made to the establishment of hospitals for the wounded.
Nearly a hundred years, however, passed away before military
hospitals were established on a permanent basis, and we have
seen how imperfectly all these hospitals even fulfilled the object
for which they were nominally created.
We have seen, nevertheless, that since the importance of
making some special provisions for the care of the sick and
wounded first began to be recognized, such provisions have been
<pb>
if slowly, yet steadily increased and perfected. An immense field
for improvement is still open; would that governments were not
less conscious of this than philanthropic individuals, that all might
unite their efforts in order to accomplish those reforms in the
sanitary service of armies, which are demanded as well by the
social and material changes which have affected the relations of
armies to states, as by the more eidightened and humane senti-
ment of the age!
Whoever would discover the extent to which it may be pos-
sible to ameliorate the condition of sick and wounded soldiers,
and reduce the mortality rate in armies—whoever would take
into serious consideration the practical measures necessary to the
accomplishment of this object—must be prepared for an investiga-
tion of many difficult and most complex problems. Indeed such
a variety of knowledge is required in the investigation of this
general subject, that a complete and substantial reform in army
sanitation, and in the means of dispensing succour to the sick
and wounded, can only be obtained through the joint labours
of many. It will be necessary to examine each question from
several points of view; the laws of health and disease are not
alone to be considered; while a variety of conditions, which may
be classed somewhat generally as political and military neces-
sities, will often influence very materially the results of each
inquiry.
The best final results, whether special or general, can however
only be reached by combining the facts of individual experience.
Every serious experiment, made for the purpose of arriving at the
truth, upon any one question which intimately concerns the
welfare of the sick soldier, has therefore a positive value.
I am acquainted with no subject connected with the service
of armies which is more important than that relating to the
hospitalization of the sick, and a brief general history of which I
have given. I was accordingly greatly gratified to find that the
American International Sanitary Committee entertained this
opinion also. Formed, as soon as the late Franco-German war
had been declared, and with the intention of engaging with
similar associations upon a general work of active charity and
beneficence, by preparing and sending out to the sick and
<pb>
wounded the means of immediate relief, wherever the want might
be greatest, this committee saw very soon the importance of so
directing its work that the facts observed by its agents might be
made to contribute in the largest degree possible to the general
improvement of the present army sanitary service; and the
special question in connection with this service, which presented
itself to the committee as the one whose solution was perhaps
most immediately important, related to the best practical measures
which could be adopted for the hospitalization of troops in the
field. The question in its terms was very simple. Do not tents
afford the best shelter which can be used in the establishment of
field hospitals ?—are not the advantages peculiar to such hospitals
when established under canvas much greater than have been
supposed, and are not the disadvantages peculiar to such hospitals
much less than have been supposed? In a word, would not the
sanitary service in European armies be more efficient, and the
mortality in those armies be greatly reduced, if, when field
hospitals were to be created, recourse was less frequently had to
public and private buildings, and a use was more frequently
made of well constructed portable tents?
Here were questions which the committee was quite at liberty
to examine in an experimental way, upon its own ground, and
without the possibility of ever finding its work obstructed and its
usefulness imperilled,—as must have been the case had it ventured
within the uncertain lines of moving armies, where international
privileges are unrecognized, and volunteer hospital corps are
peculiarly out of place.
The Committee decided to establish a tent-hospital at Paris.
The results, as well as the special conditions under which the ex-
periment was subsequently conducted, I shall finally show. The
service which the ambulance rendered will be better appreciated,
however, after I have exposed more fully certain facts relating to
the hospitalization of the sick in modern armies.

jlLITARY hospitals may be divided into two classes, viz.,
the permanent and the temporary.
Permanent hospitals are established principally in the
interest of standing armies in times of peace.
In war, army hospitals are for the most part temporary esta-
blishments prepared to receive the sick and wounded, at points
more or less remote from the field of active operations, or within
the army itself. Those temporarily established at remote points
belong usually to a group called sedentary hospitals; those existing
at the seat of war or within the army itself may be either seden-
tary or ambulant.
A sedentary hospital is one which has been created at a
particular place, for no long indefinite time, but on such a
foundation, that its existence may be continued so long as the
circumstances themselves exist which caused it to be created.
Sedentary hospitals are established on lines of embarkation,
which speedily become what the French term lines of evacuation
—that is to say, lines of transit for those returning from, as well
as for those going to, the seat of war. They are created at those
places where supplies, munitions, &c., converge, and which are
termed bases. They are created also within the lines of armies
occupying for a time a fixed position—as in the siege of fortresses,
in the military occupation of posts, and in winter quarters.
Ambulant hospitals, ambulances,1 are field hospitals, those
1 The word ambulance, from ambulare, to move on, to tnarck, is in several respects
an unfortunate one. Introduced into our language, by the celebrity obtained by
Larrey's ambulance volante—a service organized to afford immediate relief on the
battle field, in which a light waggon was an original and characteristic instrument—
in England and the United States, the word has been applied to a waggon used for
the transportation of the sick.
In France, it was first used as a noun substantive in place of hopital ambulant, that
is to say, the hospital moving with the army. In this sense the word is still used.
As, however, since the time of Larrey, the essential elements of an ambulant
<pb>
hospitals which follow the movements of an army. The French
divide them into two classes—the ambulances volantes (ambu-
lance depots of the U. S. Reg.), and the ambulances sedentaires
(general, corps, and division field hospitals). The ambulance
sedentaire is not, strictly speaking, a sedentary hospital, since it is
sedentary only as the army to which it is attached is sedentary,
and is always in a condition to move with that army.
Hospitals, whether permanent or temporary, are established
partly from reasons of convenience. The duty of extending
succour to the disabled and helpless, once recognized, that duty
can be discharged most easily as well as most completely, by
bringing the infirm together where they may be the constant
subjects of care and attention. Some kind of shelter is necessary
for men whether well or sick, in peace as well as war. In the
establishment of hospitals, use may be made of such shelter as
may have been previously constructed, or shelter may be created
either because better fitted for the special object in view, or
because of the absence of suitable or sufficient shelter.
The primary idea to be attached to the word hospital is that
of a slielter; a hospital, strictly speaking, is neither a service nor
a charity, nor a remedy for disease, nor a place ; it is a shelter or
asylum—a construction prepared to protect its inmates—hospites
—from the inclemency of the weather. If men were unaffected by
exposure to atmospheric influences, however subject they might be
to disease, and however much they might need medical care,
there would be at least no occasion for hospitals. This is an
important fact, since, if the object of a hospital is to protect
those who are to be brought together for medical treatment from
atmospheric exposure, it should be built with the immediate pur-
pose in view of accomplishing that object—and nothing more. At
hospital have been surgeons, stretcher bearers, stretchers, waggons, medicines, &c.
The word ambulance has been applied to the service or organization obtained by the
union of these material and personal elements, and in this sense the word was, in
fact, generally employed by French medical writers before the late war.
But the enormous number of temporary hospitals, created during the late war,
has resulted in an extension of the meaning of the word, which is now popularly
and generally applied to every military hospital, called into existence during a cam-
paign.
<pb>
least, that accomplished, there is little occasion for anything more
so far as the general interests of the sick are concerned. It will of
course be understood, that, as in the construction of everything
to be used, it may be expedient to pay attention to various mat-
ters of detail which may make its use more easy, convenient, and
agreeable. But it should be observed that all such points of
construction are of secondary importance, and that whatever the
special advantages to be gained by their embodiment in the work,
they are to be objected to in principle, just in proportion as they
interfere with the most simple realization of the primitive
and more important object.
Briefly stated, the principle involved is this: since a shelter is
the object of a hospital, and as buildings and other constructions
are used for hospitals because they afford a shelter, the simpler
the building, if it affords a sufficient shelter, the better the hospital.
It is unnecessary to attempt to present in this place, in an ex-
haustive manner, the general principles which should be observed,
more or less completely, in the establishment of every hospital,
whether permanent or temporary. Although purely military
considerations may often determine by a force majeure, the spot
selected for the establishment of a hospital, and although it may be
quite impossible from a want of material means to either organize,
furnish, or maintain the hospital in the way theoretically the best,
there is at the present time very little, if any, difference of opinion
among those competent to give opinions upon sanitary questions,
with regard to several of the principal rules to be observed in con-
nection with the creation and management of such establish-
ments. Fortunately, the single principle which underlies all,
and is more important than all the others, has lately become
an accepted fact of sanitary science, and the chief difference
which now exists among those acquainted with it, only concerns
the best method of putting it into practice.
It has long since been noticed, in a loose and general way,
that where the population was most dense and men were most
crowded together, the sickness and mortality rates were highest;
the fact was observed, but the cause was unobserved. In hos-
pitals, men are necessarily crowded together, and the mortality
in these establishments, was very soon observed to be far in
<pb>
excess of that obtaining among those who, when attacked with
disease, were treated in places distant from each other.
This fact was too evident to be ignored, and finally gave rise to a ,
strong sentiment against these establishments, which found an
expression in various ways. Many eminent men towards the
close of the last century did not hesitate to declare that hos-
pitals, instead of being institutions of public utility, were pro-
ductive of more evils than benefits; that the number and size
of such establishments should be reduced, and that even their
suppression altogether would contribute to the general welfare.
Had it been possible to provide for the treatment of the
sick separately, undoubtedly, this would have been done long
ago. But this could not conveniently be done; and a high death
rate in hospitals was considered as one of the evils incident to,
and inseparable from, human society. How heavily it weighed
upon the population is shown by a curious fact. Very shortly
after the creation of civil hospitals—houses for the sick alone
—the mortality rates became so frightfully great in them that
the sick poor began to refuse to enter them, and this reluctance
speedily grew to be so general, that it was thought expedient
in France, to give back again to these establishments the earlier
and more euphemistic name of hospices. The name was changed;
but the conditions remaining the same, the new hospice proved
as deadly as the old hospital.
In the early military hospitals, the state of things was no
better—if possible, was worse. The enormous number of men,
sick, wounded, and worn out by fatigue, who were constantly
crowded into these hospitals—crowded into the same room
—crowded into the same bed—is almost incredible. Well might
a writer of the time despairingly exclaim:—" Military hospitals
are an unfathomable gulf; the source of their horrors appears
to be inexhaustible."1 Soldiers could scarcely be induced to go
to these establishments, and the repugnance with which they
were regarded was universal.
For a long time the principal cause of the great mortality exist-
ing in hospitals was not clearly and fully understood. It was be-
1 "Turpin de Crisse." Op. cit.; tome ii. p. 84, et pas/dm.
Q
<pb>
lieved by some, to be attributable largely to the constitutional
vices of the sick, occasioned by poverty or by the hardships and
fatigues peculiar to camp life. Others, while recognizing these as
possible causes, believed that the excessive mortality was more
immediately occasioned by a deficiency of medicines, food, and
clothing, and a want of care and attention on the part of all those
whose duty it was to provide for the sick. In short, faults of
special and general administration were made the chief subjects of
criticism, by those who during the past century were interested
in reforming military and civil hospitals.
One fact could not, however, escape general notice, viz., that the
space within hospitals was altogether insufficient for the numbers
who were continually brought to their doors. As it was rarely
deemed possible to refuse sheltering these homeless applicants
for charity,1 rooms were crowded with beds, into which, that all
might share alike, it became necessary to place rarely less than
two patients, and these, occasionally, seriously ill or severely
wounded. The mere physical discomfort and distress resulting
from such a practice can scarcely be imagined." The atmosphere
in these rooms, often close and cell-like, badly lighted, and desti-
tute even of fire-places, speedily became so charged with vitiated
emanations of every sort as to be quite insupportable, except to
those habituated to it. While the impossibility of cleanliness in
such circumstances, or even of an observance of the commonest
decencies of life, resulted in abominations which shocked every
sense, and, blunting the finer sentiments alike of patients and
attendants, converted these places into sinks of moral as well as
physical filthiness.

sick makes it necessary to put two sick into the same bed, this shall be done succes-
sively, commencing with those who can bear the doubling with the least inconvenience.

It is not surprising, therefore, to find over-crowding among the
numerous faults specified as peculiar to the hospitals of the past
century. But if it was observed that where the over-crowding
was greatest the mortality rates were highest, the cause of this
relation was not well understood, and the ill consequences were
commonly very vaguely spoken of.
In former times there was a great fear of contagious diseases,
and it was believed, very justly, that they were likely to prove
most destructive where men were brought most closely in contact
with each other.1 Diseases were also believed to assume often a
more virulent type in an atmosphere already corrupted by the
presence of disease. But that air once respired, whether by a
man in health or disease, was unfit for respiration, was an active
propagator of disease, was itself a poison, were facts not generally
known. One of the earliest statements which I have found in
which these facts are clearly recognized is expressed in the
form of an aphorism in the preface to a little treatise by Van
Swieten. It is as follows:—" The lodging of a number of men in
a place wanting in space should be avoided with the greatest
care; but should it at any time become necessary, the air must be
renewed there as often as possible—whether the men who are
lodged together are well or sick, for it is from a want of ventila-
tion that the most dangerous diseases arise, including even those
which are contagious." 2
So, Sir John Pringle, referring to outbreaks of " hospital fever"
(typhus), says :—"On these occasions it is common to look out for
1 One of the most remarkable facts, connected with public hygiene, during the
eighteenth century, was the prevalence of the itch. The disease seemed to be endemic
pretty nearly everywhere, and to break out as an epidemic wherever men were long as-
sembled together. According to M. Bailly, in one of the Reports of the Committee of
the French Academy appointed in 1786, to investigate the subject of hospitalization:—
"The itch is almost universal at the Hotel Dieu—it is an inexhaustible source from
which the disease is spread through Paris." But it was a scourge of armies as well as
hospitals. Says Munro (1704):—" In military hospitals, there is no malady so common
as the itch;" and it appears to have been, at least in the French army, the occasion
for adopting more rigorous measures for securing the isolation of patients than any
other malady, whether contagious or infectious.

les Armees." Paris, 1760; p. xxii.
<pb>
close and warm houses, and, therefore, to prefer a peasant's house
to his barn, but experience has convinced us that air more than
warmth is required. It may be received as a maxim that the
more fresh air we let into hospitals the less danger there will be
of breeding this dangerous distemper." 1 Nor have a larger experi-
ence and a rigorous study of the causes which influence health
and disease led, in recent times, to conclusions more just than
these:—" In fact, as the experience of every time has shown, it is in
war and in the midst of camps and great hospitals, that those
diseases are seen to spring up, which transported spread like a
torrent among mankind. To limit and circumscribe the con-
tagion within a small district, there should be formed in the
vicinity of camps a quartier de sante, provided with everything
needful, but where the sick should be treated under tents, or in
barracks constructed of the branches of trees or of boards. Not
only is the danger of infection, so frequent in the wards of
hospitals, thus avoided, but the sick are spared the fatigue of
transport, and the spread of the contagion is prevented ; while if
the place is well chosen, the freshness and purity of the air, and
the action of the light contribute to the cure, and render con-
valescence more prompt, relapses less frequent, and the result less
disastrous."2
It is very rarely, however, until near the close of the century,
that we find allusions to the importance of keeping the air
pure and fresh within hospitals. In fact, it was not until in
1786, a committee having been appointed by the French Academy
of Sciences, to investigate the means of obviating the effects of
overcrowding in hospitals, that the subject of ventilation appears
to have received in- France, any very serious attention.'1 Lavoi-
sier, the celebrated chemist, was a member of this committee,

'The committee, in its report of March 12, 1788, upon the conditions essential
to a model hospital, proposed an assemblage of separate pavilions; in short, the
general plan of construction, therein set forth, was identical with that which was
adopted fifty-eight years later in the construction of L'Hopital Lariboisiere.
<pb>
and to him we owe the first scientific formula of the amount of
air consumed by a man, and which consequently it was necessary
to replace each hour.1 During the period which immediately
followed, the importance of paying attention to the atmospheric
condition of hospitals, was still more clearly revealed by La
Rochfoucauld-Liancourt, Pastoret, and other earnest investiga-
tors. But singular as it may seem, the efforts of these inquirers
appear to have been expended principally in proving the disas-
trous consequences of over-crowding, rather than in ascertaining
the specific causes of the danger, or trying to discover practical
expedients whereby they might be avoided ; whatever amelio-
rations were effected by them were reduced practically to an
enlargement of the space—an increase in the number of cubic
metres of air—allowed to each patient. With regard to measures
having a direct relation to ventilation itself, that is, to the expul-
sion of foul air and the introduction of fresh air, very little was for
a long time accomplished by anyone, and the internal atmospheric
conditions of French hospitals remained quite what they had pre-
viously been, excepting only as they might have been improved
by a reduction of the absolute number of patients shut up in a
given space, until as late as 1846, when the first ventilating
apparatus which was ever used, in Paris or in France, was intro-
duced as an experiment into one of the pavilions of the hospital
Beaujon.2
That no special arrangement should have been made, previously
to this date, for the ventilation of hospitals is all the more re-
markable, inasmuch as some of the very systems of artificial venr
tilation now found most effective had long before been suggested,
and were by no means unknown during the whole century, which
preceded the experiment at the hospital Beaujon. In 1741,
Sutton proposed a method of expelling foul air from ships, by
means of pipes which were to pass from different parts of the ship
to the cooking galley, where the fires were to obtain their air
supply through these pipes, so arranged as to open into the fires.
This very effective and excellent plan never came into use,
1 See Husson, op. cit. p. 51.
2 Ibid. p. 55.
<pb>
although it has been many times strongly commended, and was
substantially the one adopted by Dr. Mapleton, for the ventila-
tion of the hospital ships used by the English in the Chinese war
of I860.1 A modification of Sutton's plan for ventilating ships
was recommended a few years later by Munro, as applicable to
hospitals. Holes were to be cut in the ceiling, six, eight, or ten
inches in diameter, opening into a wooden box or pipe, the ex-
tremity of which was to enter into the chimney of the ward, just
above the fire. By means of such pipes, the air was renewed—or
rather, the foul air was drawn out of several of the wards of St.
George's Hospital in London in the middle of the last century.
About the same time M. de Premenil de St. Malo suggested a
method of ventilating rooms, where there were chimneys, by
dividing each chimney into two funnel-shaped compartments, one
of which was to serve as a conduit for the smoke, and the other
for fresh air. Hales, an English contemporary, suggested for
obtaining a fresh-air supply, in public buildings and ships, the
use of a kind of bellows to be worked by hand. Hales' idea
nearly a hundred years later, was modified and improved by Dr.
Arnott, and to some extent adopted in England. A plan for ob-
taining a fresh air supply by mechanical means, which has recently
been extensively adopted, was proposed by Desaguiliers as early
as 1734. Desaguiliers proposed to drive the air by means of a fan
into a conduit, from which it was to be distributed through branch
pipes into the rooms where it might be needed. Yet, notwith-
standing a variety of plans for renewing the air in apartments
were suggested during the last century, it was only after the ob-
servations of Lavoisier and Tenon, and the committee of the
Academy of Sciences, that the importance of ventilation began
to be recognized, and fifty years more were allowed to pass
away in France, and without reference in the meantime to
the results of English experience, before any serious attempt
was made to improve the interior atmospheric condition of
hospitals.

<pb>
Certainly the position of the patient was vastly improved by
the additional room given to him, but the idea of remedying the
evil results of overcrowding, by a simple increment of the space
assigned each patient was false in principle.
"Capacity," says M. Felix Leblanc, "can only retard the
moment when ventilation shall become necessary," 1 and it may be
said with quite as much truth, that the special importance which
has been ascribed to cubic space, has only served to retard im-
provements in general ventilation.
The reason why overcrowding is destructive to life, is not
because ten men, instead of one, are shut up in a room containing
2,000 cubic feet of air, but because any enclosed space in which
men are placed, where the air cannot be renewed, speedily
becomes infected and pernicious. Mere space is simply a ques-
tion of comfort and convenience, while atmospheric purity—the
presence of fresh and uncontaminated air—is an essential con-
dition of health.
This point is a very important one, and one which is still not
well understood, notwithstanding what has been written and
said on the subject of ventilation during the past thirty years.
Hygienists still often speak of the danger of placing a large
number of men in a small apartment; while even in the English
army medical regulations—the indication of the specific means
of securing a proper ventilation is limited to the ordering of a
certain cubic space for each sick soldier.2 Now, a room may
be filled with people, without danger from a want of space
providing the vitiated air is expelled, and replaced by fresh air
with sufficient rapidity and completeness; whereas a single
person in a close room, however large it might be, would sooner
or later die, poisoned by his own exhalations, as well as from an
insufficient supply of oxygen. A man might be boxed up in a
packing-case, and yet not suffer in the slightest degree from
what is popularly termed overcrowding. Overcrowding is not
necessarily connected with an atmosphere soiled by animal exha-
lations and the products of organic decomposition, and the word

should not be used to represent such a condition. It came into
use when the cause of the occasionally observed insalubrity of
apartments, occupied by considerable numbers of people, was not
well known; now that we know the cause, we should state it
clearly and call it by its right name—a want of ventilation.
The whole subject is practically expressed by the single word
ventilation, which signifies the expulsion from an apartment of
contaminated impure air, and a corresponding introduction of
uncontaminated pure air. General Morin has very well said that
the principal object of ventilation, from a hygienic point of view
"is to extract vitiated air from the spot where it is produced;" 1
and he even takes occasion to observe, that those persons who
have been principally concerned with the means of supplying
fresh air in places needing purification, have committed a logical
mistake, and have reversed the question; and that, pre-occupied
with the means of assuring a supply of fresh air, they have more
or less neglected the measures necessary to get rid of the foul
air.2 Whatever may be the truth of this observation, the prin-
cipal object of ventilation is, unquestionably, to discharge from
the atmosphere of spaces more or less confined, and occupied by
men or animals, those exhalations and products of exhalations
and of organic decompositions which, remaining in the atmo-
sphere, change its normal character, render it unsuitable for
respiration, and impart to it absolute properties prejudicial to
health and destructive even to life.
Practically, it is unnecessary to enter into a consideration of
the causes why air charged with animal exhalations is prejudicial
to health. However interesting such inquiries may be, they are
attended with great difficulties, and a solution of many of the
questions at issue is remote, if not impossible. It may be useful,
however, to remember that if crowded habitations are usually
unhealthy, it is not in general because of the presence of a
certain proportion of this or that gas, or this or that organic
impurity, or from the absence even of a certain proportion of
oxygen, but because an atmosphere, in proportion as it is charged
1 "Etudes sur la Ventilation," par Arthur Morin. Paris, 1863; tome i. pp.
109, 110. 4 Ibid.
<pb>
with the products of decomposing matter, sets at work decom-
posing forces, which attack the structural forms of living as well
as dead animal matter; or it may be said, that an atmosphere
thus impure, becomes a condition which favours the liberation or
increased activity of the germinal principles of disease, whether
these principles exist without the body or within it.
With the understanding, therefore, that it is not overcrowding
but impure air which is to be feared, and that we are not to
measure the degree of impurity present in any given atmosphere
simply by the proportion of carbonic acid or some other gas, or
the amount of dust or molecular matter existing in it, but by
its influence on health, the subject of hospital ventilation so
entirely comes within the limits of common observation, as to
promise to those who would investigate it immediate and prac-
tical results.
Since the introduction of efficient systems of ventilation, the
condition of our public hospitals has certainly been greatly im-
proved, and nothing has contributed more powerfully towards
this Improvement than the constantly reduced death-rate that
has followed every successful measure which has been adopted, to
increase the purity of the atmosphere within the wards of these
establishments. The statistics bearing upon this subject—over-
whelming in number—are quite irrefutable; and at the present
time no truth of sanitary science is more universally recognized,
than that the salubrity of hospitals and their fitness to be used as
asylums for the sick, are to be estimated principally by the degree
of atmospheric purity which can be and is constantly maintained
in them.
It has moreover been observed, that the wounded are particu-
larly subject to be influenced by the condition of the atmosphere
around them. A close, ill-ventilated apartment is even more
prejudicial to them than to the sick, while the best surgical
results which have ever been obtained, have been obtained when
the wounded have been treated in separate houses or in places
thrown widely open, where the ventilation in fact was most com-
plete and perfect.

HE expediency of constructing and maintaining perma-
nent military hospitals, whether on a large or on a small
scale, must be determined entirely by circumstances spe-
cial to each state. Where large standing armies are supported,
such establishments are indispensable as well in times of peace as
of war. The plans, which have been adopted in the construction
of such hospitals, have usually differed in no essential respect,
from those thought best, at the time, in the construction and dis-
position of the buildings intended for permanent civil hospitals.
It is evident that as they are designed to serve—from a sanitary
point of view-—a nearly or quite identical purpose, the same
principles of construction should be observed in each class. The
importance of a proper location, of sufficient room, light, venti-
lation, &c., are all now theoretically recognized, and means of
obtaining these conditions are adopted similar to those used in
civil hospitals, and with like results.
One of the finest permanent hospitals in Europe, is the French
military hospital at Vincennes. This hospital, which was opened
in 1858, consists of a central building, occupied by halls, bureaus,
&c., and two long pavilions built perpendicularly to the ends of
that building.
The central building, which forms the front of the construction,
is 68 metres long, about 13 metres deep, and four stories high.
It is surmounted, for architectural effect, by a belvedere and
gallery. The pavilions or wings are each about 130 metres in
length, four stories high, and contain each four large wards,
one above the other, besides several small wards, and various
bureaus, pharmacies, kitchens, pantries, &c. The constructions
enclose three sides of a square open upon the south. The wings
are, however, entirely separated from the front building—except
as connected on the first floor by a corridor which runs around
the three sides of the square, and shut in by glass windows,
furnishes a promenade for the convalescent, in rainy as well as
<pb>
in pleasant weather; the roof of this corridor forms a balcony
overhead, which serves as a means of communication between
the buildings. The whole establishment is thoroughly well
lighted, and the pavilions are ventilated by a system of steam
pipes and air shafts, in such a way as to secure 60 cubic metres
of fresh air to each bed per hour.
The military hospital at Bayonne is composed of five buildings
arranged around a quadrangular court, but separated one from
the other. The wards are most of them in one building, 70
metres long, 15 metres wide, and three stories high. Each of
the six principal wards contain 116 beds. The space allowed
for each bed is 28'67 cubic metres.
Larrey said of this hospital in 1862 :—" The military hospital
of Bayonne is the most complete model of modern construction
of the kind—the best conceived and the best executed—and re-
sponds perfectly to all the more essential indications of hygiene.
The appearance of the whole, and the harmony of the details,
the roominess, and the provisions for securing a ventilation of the
wards and a proper distribution of the beds, the arrangement
of the subordinate offices, and the working of the service, all
have been united to create the very best conditions of salubrity."1
These two permanent military hospitals are, probably, equal
if not superior to any of the kind in Europe, and a study of
the details of their plans will indicate very clearly, that if
they are in no way inferior to the very best civil hospitals of the
same class, it is because they have been constructed upon the
same general principles.
It is unnecessary, therefore, that I should occupy your atten-
tion long with this special subject. I cannot, however, refrain
from making a few observations, as they have a general as well as
special application.
The chief fault of nearly all the permanent hospitals that have
been constructed, whether in past centuries or more recently, has
arisen from an ill-defined idea of the objects to be attained in
the construction of hospital buildings, or, at least of the relative
importance of these objects.
1 "Inspection Medioale," 1862.
<pb>
The principal object to be kept in view should be the construc-
tion of the best permanent shelter for the sick. Another object, of
some importance, is that this shelter should be conveniently dis-
posed—first, for the sick; secondly,, for the attendants. Pre-
suming the place selected to be a suitable one, these are the only
general objects which should be regarded in the construction of
such hospitals, and the hospital plan which most completely
realizes them will always be the best.
Unfortunately, however, when any large public building is to
be erected, a variety of interests are immediately concerned quite
independent of the principal object of the construction itself.
The idea of permanency is commonly brought very prominently
forward. A provision is to be made not only for the sick of to-day,
but for the sick and needy of all future generations; the buildings
should, therefore, be of the most substantial character, and if
they are to last for ever, should not only be so constructed as to
finally become memorials of ancient beneficence, but should be
made monuments as well of the taste of their founders, as of the
architectural skill of the age, and of their builders. Nearly every
proposition to construct a large building at the public expense,
is seized upon as an occasion for the perpetuation of a multitude
of human sentiments, more or less honourable, but which might
not unfrequently have been better expressed in some other
way. So long, however, as sentimental modifications in no
way interfere with the usefulness of the building as an instru-
ment for a specific work, we may have no reason to object to
them; and this is generally the case. In the construction of
most of our public buildings the architect should be free
to expend the public money in the production of the noblest
forms of his art; with churches, offices of state, and the innumer-
able buildings created for innumerable purposes, he has a field
opened sufficiently wide as well for his special genius as for our
gratification. We protest, however, against his attempting to
dictate to us the forms of our hospitals. No architect ever yet
constructed a permanent hospital which did not prove to be a
monstrous failure, and the few redeeming merits which may be
found within his piles of stone and brick are but the shattered
fragments of systems, which from some cause he was unable to
completely crush.
<pb>
It is the business of sanitary science, and of sanitary science
only, to determine the theoretical forms and dispositions most
suitable for hospitals, and it is the business of the architect to
realize these forms and dispositions literally, so far as he is able
to do it. Of architecture as a fine art, sanitary science is ignorant,
and if the builders of hospitals were equally ignorant, whatever
the external appearance of hospitals, their interior condition
would be much less frequently a subject of reproach and oppro-
brium, while the object sought would be attained with an im-
mense saving in cost—both immediate and remote.
Temporary hospitals are indispensable in time of war; and not
only are they indispensable, but most of the sick and wounded
during campaigns must, of necessity, be taken care of in such
establishments. The sick and wounded must be taken care of
either within the army itself, or at places remote from the army.
It would be inexpedient to attempt to provide hospital accommo-
dation for all who might be sick, within the lines of an active
army; it would be equally inexpedient to attempt to treat the
sick only at points very far distant, and consequently difficult of
access. The transport of the sick, and particularly of the
wounded, over long routes is often highly objectionable; and
in principle long transportations are to be avoided, because of
their prejudicial effects upon those transported, and because
they entail an enormous expense, which increases rapidly with
the distance traversed. Hence the expediency of creating in
the rear of armies those temporary establishments known as
hospitals of the first and second line—general, or sedentary field
hospitals. Formerly it was the universal practice to establish
these hospitals in such public and private buildings as could
be obtained for the purpose; but it has not always been easy
to obtain, in the places where it may have been desirable to
have such hospitals, buildings which could be readily converted
into establishments uniting the essential conditions of a fit and
suitable shelter for the sick; and it has been much more difficult
in modern times to find such buildings, because our standards of
fitness and suitableness are more exacting than formerly.
Indeed, this difficulty must be considered as one of the principal
reasons for the construction of temporary establishments intended
<pb>
especially for the sick of armies. Churches, hotels, convents, and
private houses, are often badly located, badly lighted, and inca-
pable of being well ventilated. Grave surgical operations rarely
succeed in military hospitals established in these buildings, and the
common mortality rates from diseases are in such hospitals no-
toriously in excess of those obtaining either in private dwellings or
in public hospitals; rarely in military hospitals has the mortalitjr
rate among the sick fallen below ten per cent. The average mor-
tality rate among the sick, for the whole period of the war in the
United States, scarcely rose above three per cent. and the most
obvious cause for this low rate was the excellent and efficient
system of hospital organization adopted by the American Govern-
ment at the very beginning of the war. The immediate influence
of the character of the hospital accommodation upon mortality
rates, was even still more remarkable in the Crimea, where,
while improperly sheltered, nearly the whole English army
perished—the survivors learning that, with proper shelter and
care, the mortality in the field might be reduced to a rate
scarcely, if at all exceeding, that common to the home service.1
To these results of recent experience, we are therefore chiefly in-
debted for the increasing favour with which governments as well
as sanitarians have entertained the idea of establishing hospitals
in constructions erected with reference to the special use to which
they are to be put. Fortunately, it is comparatively easy to
secure in such establishments those general conditions, which
experience as well as theory has pronounced most essential to
the welfare of the sick. The locations can be selected; the
buildings, designed only for a temporary use, can be erected
almost solely with reference to furnishing a shelter for the sick;
an abundant aeration can thus be obtained by the simplest and
cheapest mechanical devices; outlets and inlets .for the air can be
placed wherever they may be needed, in order to obtain the
1 According to Miss Nightingale, during the first seven months of the Crimean
campaign, the mortality among the English troops from disease alone amounted to
a yearly death rate of sixty per cent, of the present strength of the army, while during
the last five months of the campaign the mortality from disease did not exceed a
yearly average of one and one-tenth per cent. "Report of the Commissioners appointed

<pb>
largest and most constant interchange between the interior and
exterior atmospheres; while the very rudeness and imperfection
of the construction often serve to fit it, all the more completely,
to be used as a shelter for a large number of sick; and it is not a
little remarkable that the very earliest wise and practical con-
clusions, concerning the relative fitness of buildings to serve as
hospitals, were the results of the accidental use of constructions
generally supposed to be wholly unfit for such a service.1
Says Richard Brocklesby:—-"In October 1758, a greater num-
ber of the sick were landed out of the transports on the Isle of
Wight, than all the spare out-houses, barns, and empty cottages
which could be procured for money or the sake of humanity, at
Newport, were capable of containing. In this distress, some
gentlemen of the hospital proposed to erect a temporary shed
with deal boards upon the open forest, and to have it thatched
over with new straw, thick enough to keep out wind and rain,
and capacious enough to hold 120 patients or upwards, for
doing which and the use of the wards, the country workman
who was undertaker exacted forty pounds. Although the hovel
was finished in a manner the most slovenly and apparently in-
adequate to the end proposed, upon trial it was found that, not-
withstanding much extraordinary cold as well as moisture which
the sick there lodged had suffered, remarkably fewer died of
the same diseases, though treated with the same medicines and
1 MM. Demogetand Brossard ("Etude sur les Construction des Ambulances tempo-
raires," Paris, 1871), state that the idea of barrack hospitals, which has recently been
put in practice, has not only been recommended by physicians of our own time, but
also by physicians of the middle ages, and they support the statement by passages from
the " Opuscule ou Traictcs divers et curieux en Medicine," par Francois Ranchin, Lyon,
1640. Ranchin simply recommended the building of huts for pest patients, from
the impossibility of their being received in hospitals and private houses, and as a
sort of quarantine for the disinfection of a city. He says, that during the plague at
Montpellier, he and his companions constructed a hundred huts outside of the city:
"C'etait comme une petite ville de bois. Et au plus haut des huttes nous fismes
construire une belle chapelle," <fec. But it is very evident, from his own statements,
that what he commended and did, was done less by reason of the hygienic advan-
tages to be thus secured to the sick, than for the purpose of protecting the well
against infection. "L'institution des leproseries . . . semble avoir eti moins
une ceuvre de charite qu'une mesure de police sanitaire."—Vie Militaire et Beligieuse
au Moyen Age, par Paul Lacroix. Paris, 1873, p. 381. A work highly esteemed by

<pb>
the same general remedies, than died anywhere else ; and all the
convalescent recovered much sooner than they did in any of the
warmer and closer huts and barns hired around Newport, where
fires, and apparently better accommodations of every sort could
be provided for them." "This fact, so remarkable," induced
Brocklesby in 1760 to make the experiment himself of treating
the sick in temporary huts. The results he then obtained were
such as to induce him to say:—" I hope to see due provision
in time previously appointed, to have a large ship or two from
North America, or elsewhere, with lumber and boards always
attending the fleet, and whenever a landing is once made good in
any warm climate, occasional huts, such as I have described, may
be constructed at proper distances from the fleet and army, instead
of being under the necessity of huddling officers and common
men, in the same wretched holds of hospital ships hereafter." 1
Munro says he was told by Dr. Hume, that a malignant fever
having broken out on board of some men-of-war, conveying troops
to America in 1755, the fever spread rapidly during the voyage,
but that on arriving at Halifax, the sick "were lodged in tents, or
very old shattered houses that admitted the air very freely, which put
a sudden and effectual stop to the disorder."2 A number of in-
stances such as these might be cited, in which the beneficial
effects upon the sick of occupying buildings open to the air had
been observed before the close of the last century. Still, no serious
attempt was anywhere made to profit by these observations, and
the establishment of sedentary hospitals for the sick, which might
realize the special excellencies of the open constructions referred
to, scarcely dates farther back than the Crimean war. Wooden
barrack hospitals were for the first time made use of on a large
scale during that war. The results of the experience then ob-
tained were satisfactory, and moreover, a spirit of inquiry was
created, which led to the announcement of many important
principles connected with the hospitalization of armies, in reports
and writings which appeared a short time before the breaking
out of the war of the Rebellion in the United States, in the

<pb>
spring of 1861. It is therefore not without reason that M. Michel
Levy has said:—" The experiments which we made in the East, in
1854-55, with hospitals in tents and barracks, certainly gave to
our confreres in the United States the idea of testing the same
system upon such an immense scale." 1 So also, in a report
issued from the office of the surgeon-general of the United
States army, it is said:—" The introduction of these pavilion
hospitals was not the work of any one man. Originally suggested
by European experience, they were erected in all parts of the
country, under the direction of various medical officers, some
by order of the surgeon-general, others by the authority of local
commanders."' But these statements are incomplete ; what-
ever support the constructors of American barrack hospitals
may have derived from the Crimean experience, the real, the
principal reason for the construction on a large scale, of special
temporary hospitals, in the United States, was the impossibility
of finding in many parts of that country buildings available for
hospital purposes. This indeed was the original and principal
cause of the creation of such establishments in the Crimea.
The unsuitableness of common buildings, churches, hotels,
&c., was only thoroughly well understood after it became possible
to compare the results obtained in buildings, which had been
especially erected to serve as temporary hospitals, with the
results obtained in those, which had only provisionally been
converted to that use.
In short, the establishment of special constructions, to be used as
hospitals in the rear of armies, dates from the time of the Crimean
War, and received its largest and completest development in the
United States, during the War of the Rebellion. Since that time
the system of employing special constructions for the hospitaliza-
tion of the sick, has been partially adopted in practice by the
Austrians and Prussians, and in principle by the English. By
the French, the system has not yet been adopted, either in prac-
tice or in principle, the administration still relying upon the
shelter furnished by the ordinary buildings of the country, in the
establishment of its temporary hospitals.

The general character of the sedentary hospitals, which have
been recently especially constructed to receive the sick and
wounded of armies, may be summarily stated. Each hospital, of
this class, is usually a group of detached pavilions built of wood,
a portion of which are erected to furnish bed room for patients,
while another portion are intended to serve various purposes in
connection with the general administration of the establish-
ment. The unit of the organization is the pavilion, or ward for
the sick.
As, however, wooden pavilion or barrack hospitals hold a very
important place among the provisions now made for the care of
sick soldiers, it may be well to here indicate some of the special
characteristics of these establishments, as also some of the modi-
fications in construction which have been at different times
either adopted or suggested.
According to a circular-order issued by the United States
War Department,1 the unitary building, or ward-pavilion, should
be 187 feet long, 24 feet wide, and 14 feet high, from the floor to
the eaves—the pitch of the roof varying according to the materials
composing it. At each extremity, two small rooms were to be
partitioned off—those at one extremity to be used as a bath-
room and water closet, those at the other, as a medicine closet
and nurse room. The intermediate space—165 feet long—was
to be occupied by beds, 30 being placed on each side of the room.
About 1,000 cubic feet of space were thus allowed to each patient.
The pavilion was entered by four doors, one at each extremity,
and one in the middle of each side; it was lighted by 36 win-
dows, 16 being on each side. The ventilation of the ward was
also intended to be partially obtained by means of the doors and
windows, especially by the windows, which faced each other, and
could be let down at the top. Ventilation was, however, princi-
pally effected, in the summer, through an open ridge, protected by
1 This circular-order, issued as late as July 20th, 1864, is to be considered simply
as an official statement and recognition of the principles of hospital construction, pre-
viously accepted by the War Department. At the date mentioned, the military
hospitals of the United States had received their largest development, and, as a
matter of fact, scarcely a hospital was built after the issue of the order.
<pb>
a false roof or lantern. In the winter, the extraction of air was
accomplished by means of four cheminees d'appel—shafts—heated
each by a stove pipe. Each of the stoves (four in number), sur-
rounded by a perforated metallic jacket, was placed over the
opening of an air-box, which was intended to furnish a supply of
fresh air. The order directed, that the floor of the ward be at
least 18 inches from the ground, with an open and free passage
for the air beneath it.
Except as regards the dimensions of length, breadth, and
height, the pavilion wards of the American barrack hospitals
seldom differed in any essential respect from the description here
given. They were built, however, with occasional slight differ-
ences in solidity, although the type of the building was a wooden
construction with a floor, walls, and roof, made of a single
thickness of boards. The joints in the walls were battened on the
outside, while the roof was covered with tarred paper, or some
other cheap water-proof covering. In the organization of a hos-
pital, from ten to fifty pavilions, similar to those described, were
grouped together "en khelon" parallel to each other, on two con-
verging lines forming a V; or as radii from the periphery of a
circle, ellipse, or rounded oblong. The buildings were to be
separated from each other at least 30 feet; and the accessory
buildings—in general construction quite like the ward-pavilions
—were to be conveniently placed within the lines of the V, or in
the centre of the circular plan. The pavilions and principal
accessory buildings were commonly united by corridors.
The number of sedentary hospitals constructed in the United
States during the war of the Rebellion upon the general plan
here indicated was very large. Most of the 202 general hospitals
existing in 1864 were of this class, and within them were also
placed most of the 136,894 beds for patients, then at the dispo-
sition of the Government.1 Since the reduction of the Federal
1 Scarcely a French writer on hospital hygiene, who has alluded to the barrack
hospitals employed in the United States during the war of the Rebellion, has failed
to repeat the ridiculous statement, that after these wooden barracks had served a
number of years, more or less, until they were presumed to have become infected,
the common custom was to set fire to them and burn them up. I can easily under-
stand, how such a story once told, might become a subject of popular tradition in
<pb>
army to a peace footing, and its distribution over the country in
small garrisons, the United States war department has recom-
mended, for hospital purposes, the construction of small wooden
barracks, which are in many respects similar to those now com-
monly used for military hospitals in the English service. These
barracks are warmed by double fireplaces ; but the systems of
ventilation, for summer and winter, are in principle the same as
that employed in the long pavilions during the war.
The English model hospital-barrack is small as compared with
the large American pavilion. Its walls are double ; this is a
very considerable advantage, as the barrack is thus warmer in
the winter and cooler in the summer. The building is raised
above the soil so as to permit a free circulation of air beneath
the floor. The inside walls are made of hard material, which
can be washed, while the floors are made of planks of dense
wood, the joints between which are filled with cement. The
floors are to be kept clean by waxing. The wards are warmed
by radiant heat from open fireplaces, and are ventilated naturally
through outlets and inlets. The pavilions, when grouped together,
are to be separated from each other by intervals equal in width to
twice the height of the pavilions; and they are to be connected by
corridors. The hospital-barracks now in use in England are fre-
quently two stories high,—a fact of some economical importance
in building, but objectionable from a hygienic point of view, as it
has been shown pretty conclusively that the mortality rate among
the sick increases with the number of the superposed stories.1
France, but that for a period of years it should be seriously repeated in nearly every
new essay or chapter on hospitalization, is more wonderful, than that an account of
Mark Twain's stone man should have once appeared in the columns of the Lancet
If a barrack'has become infected by long use, it certainly ought not to serve any
longer as a hospital, and when this conclusion has been reached, its history for the
sanitarian is finished. Whether it is burned up, or otherwise disposed of, can very
rarely be a matter of consequence to him; but to those who have paid for and own
the building, the value of the material entering into its construction, will generally
be considered as of more importance than an absurd coup de tlitetre.
No wooden barrack hospitals were burned up in the United States, except by
accident, but at the close of the war, the necessity having entirely ceased which
called them into existence, they were all sold to the highest bidder.

During the Crimean war single-storied pavilions or "huts"
were generally used. Most of the "huts," constructed es-
pecially for hospital purposes, had double walls, and were
provided with a ridge ventilation.1 They varied considerably
in capacity, holding from fourteen to fifty beds, and although
essentially the earliest samples of barrack hospital construction,
they are doubtless still in some respects the best. They were
found to answer well the purpose for which they were intended,
and have since been commended for sedentary war hospitals by
English hygienists.
Before the Franco-German war, the theory of the barrack
system of hospitalization had so far been received into favour in
Germany, as to have been in several instances adopted in connec-

tion with the civil hospitals of large cities. One of the earliest
and most remarkable of these constructions was erected, as an
annex to the Charity Hospital at Berlin, by Dr. Esse in 1867.
Constructed confessedly as a result of American military experi-
ence, although itself a civil establishment, some account of it
may not here be out of place, especially as I am not aware if any
description of it has yet appeared in English.2
A good general idea of the appearance and form of the build-
ing may be derived from the sketch (Fig. 1), which presents a
1 "Report of the proceedings of the Sanitary Commission despatched to the seat
of war in the East, 1855-56," pp. 134,135, 142, et passim.

annex to the military hospital at Berlin.
<pb>
lateral view of the barrack, and which exhibits to the eye
several of the details of construction I shall have occasion to
allude to. The size of the establishment was limited by a want
of ground space; it consists therefore of a single barrack, 84 feet
long and 29 feet wide, with two covered side galleries, or
piazzas, 4£ feet wide, and a verandah at each end, projecting
about 10 feet. The total length of the building is thus 104
feet, and its total breadth 38 feet. The lateral walls are 13£
feet high, the height from the floor to the ridge being 19 feet.
The roof projects over the side galleries, and also covers the
end verandahs. One of these verandahs—that to the right in
the sketch—serves as an ante-chamber, and is fitted up with
seats and benches; the other contains six beds to be used by
patients, whenever the weather permits.
As the barrack was intended for use in the winter as well as in
the summer, special precautions were taken to make it a secure
shelter against cold and wet. The walls of the barrack were ac-
cordingly constructed as follows:—A thin wooden wall having
been erected, on each side of this, parallel with and a certain dis-
tance from it, were placed two additional walls of boards set up
vertically and battened. There were consequently two free spaces
between the middle and the outer and inner walls. The outside
space was filled up with small fragments of brick—a substance
for certain reasons thought preferable to peat, tan, straw, and
other non-conductors. The inner space was left open for a pur-
pose which I shall soon explain, remarking however in this con-
nection, that the roof and floor were formed, as were the walls,
so as to enclose two compartments—the outer filled, the inner
free. The barrack rests upon dies, which hold it up quite five feet
from the ground—much higher than has been usual in erecting
such buildings. The roof is covered with slate, but is open
along nearly the whole line of the ridge, which is protected by a
lantern, called an American roof or Reiterdach. The lantern
differs however from those which were generally placed upon
American pavilions, in being wider and higher, as also in
being furnished on each side with a row of moveable windows.
The barrack fronts to the south, and the steps at the entrance
are covered by a marquee, or small projecting roof. The
<pb>
galleries on the sides are closed in by railings, which extend the
whole length of the building, while on the lines of these railings
posts support and strengthen the roof. Fastened to the top of
the railing, and between each pair of posts, is a roll of canvas,
which, when drawn up, forms a curtain. By means of these
curtains the sun and rain can be quite shut out of the galleries
when desired. The barrack is lighted on each side by twelve
windows, opening outward. The ward-room within the walls of
the barrack contains twenty beds, each placed three feet from the
walls, a free space of ten feet remaining between each bed. At
the north end of this room, two small chambers, nine feet square,
were partitioned off—one, serving for the watcher, the other, for a
wash-room and water-closet. The wash-room is supplied with
hot and cold water delivered from the reservoirs of the hospital;
a gas stove is also placed here as a matter of convenience in
the preparation of dressings, &c. The verandah fronting on the
south, furnished with chairs and benches, was intended as a place
where the sick might sit in the open air, or repose after having
walked or taken exercise within the side galleries. The side
galleries were intended to be used by the patients in pleasant
weather as a promenade, and also at the same time to furnish a
place for beds, where certain sick or wounded could take the air
in pleasant weather. The north verandah, capable of being
enclosed on the sides with curtains, is occupied by six beds, and
is used in the summer as a tent-barrack. The ventilation in the
summer is maintained by the doors and windows, but more par-
ticularly through the opened windows of the lantern. In the
winter, the building is warmed and ventilated as follows:—Two
stoves are placed on the long axis of the floor of the ward,
about equidistant from each other and the ends of the ward.
These stoves are each enclosed in a porcelain envelope,
that also includes a portion of the smoke pipe; this is
coiled, to increase the evolution of heat from it, before it
ascends vertically through the roof. The porcelain envelope
also contains another pipe, which ascends parallel with the
smoke pipe, and the function of which we shall presently
see. The hot air enters the barrack, through registers inserted
in the porcelain envelope, and is distributed through the
<pb>
ward. But it will be remembered that between the walls, and
the floors also, there is a space that envelopes as it were the
entire ward. Now an arrangement has been made by which the
warm and vitiated air of the ward shall escape into this space
through openings which communicate with it near the floor, and
the circulation is forced or drawn in this direction by the second
pipe, which I have spoken of as enclosed in the porcelain
envelope, and which, communicating with the space beneath the
floor, constantly acts as a cheminee d'appel. This system of heating
and ventilating has the advantage of being not only efficient, but
of being exceedingly economical. The floor of the ward is sur-
rounded with warm air, and very little heat fails to be utilized.
This experimental barrack has proved most successful, and
has yielded surgical results highly satisfactory to those who
created it, and which have strongly tended to commend and
make popular, in Germany, the treatment of the sick in barracks.
During the late war, barracks on this plan were constructed in
considerable numbers, at Berlin and other cities of Germany.
The Friedrich's Hospital at Carlsruhe, which was considered
second to none in Germany, consisted of six wooden ward-
barracks, each 151 feet (German) long, 29 feet broad, and 23
feet high; they contained each 32 beds. The six barracks
complete cost 71,000 florins, and were very handsomely finished
and furnished. They were heated and ventilated, as were also
the barracks erected at Heidelberg, almost precisely as were the
American pavilions.1 Still most of the German sedentary war
hospitals were built on a simpler plan—were reproductions in
all their essential details of the Crimean hut or the American
pavilion. In fact, the chief differences between the German
and American systems were these: the German barracks were
smaller, contained fewer beds than the American, were grouped
together in smaller numbers, and were usually even more
hastily constructed. The barrack hospital at Tempelhofer, near
Berlin, contained 1,500 beds; but this was almost the only
instance in which a very large general hospital was created

<pb>
during the war. And yet the fifty barracks which formed this
hospital were arranged in three separate groups, and directed by
three distinct administrations—the War Department, the City
Government, and the " Soci&e' de Secours "—each having its own
model barracks and plan of grouping the same.
The ward-barrack of the Prussian service for thirty patients is
thus described by a regulation of 1867:—
The barrack should be so placed as that one of its sides may
face the south or south-east. A dry location should be selected
where the air is free to circulate. The sward, should there be
any, should be removed from the spot the barrack is to stand
upon, and be replaced by a covering of gravel or coal-cinders
six inches deep. Three lines of dies are to be set up in masonry.
These dies should be a foot wide and a foot high, and four feet
apart on the lines corresponding with the length of the building,
and ten feet apart on the lines of its breadth; so that the
building shall be eighty-eight feet long, and twenty-one feet
wide, and be supported by sixty-nine dies. Upon these dies, or
columns of support, the traverses are to be laid for the floor, as
also, the plates upon which rest the lateral walls. These walls
shall be ten feet in height. The outside walls of the barrack are
to be formed of a frame-work of posts and plates, to which the
covering-boards are to be nailed vertically. The roof shall be
fifteen feet above the floor, and three openings shall be left in
the ridge for ventilation. The roof is to be covered with a
lathing of pine boards an inch thick, upon which is laid a course
of bituminous paper, to be whitewashed in hot weather. The
roof is to project over the walls, everywhere, from a foot to a foot
and a half. In the west end, there- is to be a door seven feet
high and four feet wide; in the east end, a door ten feet high
and ten feet wide. On each side, there are to be ten windows,
four feet by six, and four feet above the ground. On the south
side, six of the windows are to be closed with sashes and cur-
tains; the remaining four are to be closed simply by means of
canvas curtains. On the north side, all the windows are to be
furnished with sashes and glass. The windows and doors are all
to open outward. On the inside of each door there shall be a
canvas screen to prevent draughts. At the western end, two
<pb>
small rooms shall be made—one for the linen, the other for the
nurses and the preparation of the medicines; these rooms are to
be covered over, seven feet from the floor, so as to form a sort of
loft, where various articles may be stored. The latrines shall be
in a special cabinet built outside, and shall be placed in commu-
nication with the ward by means of a corridor closed by a double
door. The faecal matters are to be received in a trough tarred on
the inside, and mounted on wheels, so that it may be easily drawn

out from its place, after having been disinfected and closed by
means of a tarred cover. Before putting back this receptacle
after it has been emptied, it is to be one-fourth filled with the
Siivern mixture.1
The barrack may be built directly upon the ground if either

latrines, night utensils, <fec., is prepared as follows:—
Quick lime 100 lbs.
Coal-tar ...... 15 „
Chloride of magnesium . . . . 15 „
The lime is slacked with hot water, and the tar at the same time poured into the
mass, which it is necessary to stir continually while pouring on the water. The chlo-
ride of magnesium is added afterwards, having been previously dissolved in a closed
vessel. The quantity of water used is about five times the weight of the materials;
and would be for the quantities given about eighty gallons, giving to the mass "just
sufficient liquidity to drop slowly from a stick inserted in it and then pulled out."
<pb>
time or the materials are wanting to construct the dies, but in this
case, the ground should be covered with a thick layer of gravel or
slag. The kitchen should be in a separate building. If water-
colours are at hand, the barrack should receive a coating of wash.
A very ingenious system of barrack construction was em-
ployed at Minden (Prussia) to furnish hospital accommodation
for the French prisoners quartered in that fortress. (See Fig. 2.)
The buildings were wedge-shaped, the roof forming at the
same time the walls; a barrack thus resembled a long prism
resting on one of its faces.
Each barrack was slightly
elevated from the ground;
it had two doors, one at
each end, and was lighted
by dormer windows. The
ridge was open, and cover-
ed by a false roof or lan-
tern. The ventilation was,
however, effected princi-
pally by a modification of
the system which I have
already described, when
speaking of the barrack
at the Charity Hospital,
in Berlin. The walls and
floors of these wedge -
shaped barracks were
double; the exterior cover-
ing of the wall was made
of plain boards, covered with tarred paper; the interior was
formed by a wainscoting of clap-boards. The ward was thus
enveloped by an air-chamber, which communicated with the
ward by an open seam, on each side, along the line of the floor.
The barrack was heated by four stoves, the smoke pipes from
which entered shafts communicating with the air space beneath the
double floor. The character of the construction, and the system
of ventilation, will be made evident by a reference to the accom-
panying diagram. (Fig. 3.)

ventilation as applied to the Minden barracks—

<pb>
At the front entrance of the barrack were two rooms for the
service. The water-closet was a separate room, built out in the
middle of the barrack, and at right angles to its long axis. (See
Fig. 2.)
Several large barrack (sedentary) hospitals were erected in
France during the war of 1870-71.
The first of these owed its existence to the personal efforts of
M. Michel LeVy, who had the -honour of being the earliest and
at the same time the ablest French advocate of the open-air
system of hospitalization. This hospital was established by the
War Department in the garden of the Luxembourg, and was
designed to contain thirty-two pavilion wards, with the accessory
buildings; but twenty-two of these pavilions were erected, and
as each contained but twenty beds, the capacity of the hospital
was thus limited to 440 patients.
The wards were simple wooden pavilions 124£ feet long,
from 30 to 32 feet wide, with side walls 13 feet high; the
height, from the centre of the floor to the top of the lantern,
was 26 feet. The lantern formed a bay in the centre of the
roof, along about one-third the length of the ridge, nearly
ten feet wide, and five feet high or deep. About thirteen
feet was reserved at each end of the pavilion, for a bath-room
and water-closet at one end, and for attendants' rooms at the
other. But twenty beds having been placed in such a ward, nearly
3,600 cubic feet of space were given to each, or almost four times
as much space as was given to a patient in an American pavilion.
The Luxembourg barracks were elevated above the soil about
eighteen inches, and consisted of frame-works covered with a
single thickness of pine boards, battened both outside and inside.
The roof was boarded over, and covered with tarred paper.
As after the erection of these buildings they proved to be neither
air nor water tight, the roofing was doubled in certain places,
and the walls lined on the inside with coarse canvas and paper, as
also partially wainscoted. The ventilation was intended to be
maintained during the summer by the doors and windows. Ten
large windows were placed on each side of a pavilion, and the
sides of the lantern were fitted with windows, balanced upon
horizontal pivots, so as to open by their own weight.
<pb>
The barracks were heated by stoves, covered with envelopes
and furnished with an air supply from without. But no shafts
were used for the discharge of the vitiated air, the only outlets in
a ward, constantly open for the escape of air, being two longi-
tudinal crevices, each about one and a half inches wide, left open
at the base of the lantern.
The water-closets and bath-rooms were all fitted in a very com-
plete and admirable manner.

Practically the only differences between these barracks and the
American pavilions were: 1st. The Luxembourg barracks were
much more spacious; everything pertaining to them was on a
larger scale, the doors were larger, the windows were larger, the
walls higher ; the beds were also at the same time much larger
and much farther apart. 2nd. The barracks were unprovided
with ventilating shafts.
The barracks were badly grouped at the Luxembourg;
the kitchen and pharmacy were quite at one side of the
grounds, and far distant from several of the wards. Certain
<pb>
points in the construction, as well as in the general interior
arrangement of these barracks, are shown in the accompanying
sketches.
The plan adopted for the Luxembourg hospital, served also
for one, containing nearly the same number of pavilions, which
was erected—also by the War Department and at the suggestion
of M. LeVy—in the Jardin des Plantes, and was opened for use
at about the same time.
During the winter of 1870-1, the Direction of the "Ambulances
of the Press" constructed a barrack hospital at Passy, similar in
all essential respects to those previously organized by M. -Levy
at the Luxembourg and the Jardin des Plantes.

The " Societe de Secours aux Blesses" also began to construct
during the siege—and to finish only after its close—a hospital in
Paris, near the Palais de l'lndustrie, which although closely resem-
bling those at the Luxembourg and at Passy, yet differed in some
respects from them. The walls of the ward-pavilions were double,
and special inlets and outlets were arranged in them, to better
serve the purpose of obtaining a constant and natural ventilation.
One of the largest barrack hospitals constructed by the French
during the war, was that at Metz. This hospital was designed
to be an almost exact copy of the Lincoln hospital at Washing-
ton, both as regards its unitary ward-pavilion, and the disposi-
tion of the pavilions upon two converging lines. The pavilions at
<pb>
Metz, however, instead of being placed parallelly to a line bisect-
ing the angle enclosed by two converging lines, were slightly
inclined outward, a disposition which was supposed to facilitate
the circulation of air between the buildings, and at the same
time adapt them better to the covered corridor. The hospital
was composed of thirty pavilions, each containing fifty beds.
The unitary pavilion was very lightly and imperfectly con-
structed, even the frame-work being to a considerable extent
made of boards, while both the walls and roof were covered
with but a single thickness of overlapping boards. The
pavilion was open at the ridge, and was ventilated also by
an opening under the eaves on each side, about a foot-and-a-half
wide, extending the whole length of the building. This opening
was partially closed by the windows which were inserted in it,
and could be entirely shut up by a series of trap-doors, which
when closed, formed the piers between the windows. It was
intended that, during pleasant weather, the side opposite the
wind should always remain open beneath the eaves, the windows
and piers being hoisted up by cords arranged for the purpose.
This hospital was constructed in a great hurry, was filled up
with patients before it was finished, and gave proof, frequently
during the winter, by leaking, &c., of its imperfections. It was
chiefly remarkable from having been the occasion of an excellent
treatise on the construction of temporary hospitals, by the archi-
tect M. Demoget, as also from its having been the only tem-
porary hospital constructed, during the war, in France, of which
we have as yet a detailed statement of the cost of construction.
M. Demoget reports the total cost of the hospital, as having been
for material and work of all kinds, 163,000 francs. The location
of each bed having thus incurred an outlay of 108 francs. But at
the close of the war, the material was sold for 80,000 francs;
thus reducing the actual cost incurred for the location of a bed
to fifty francs, a sum astonishingly small.
If any advance has recently been made in the theory and
practice of barrack hospital construction, we are certainly in-
debted to the Germans for it. In constructing the German
barracks, means have never been neglected to secure a constant
ventilation in summer, and also in winter, when a winter use
<pb>
may have been anticipated.1 The open ridge, numerous
doors and windows, outlets and inlets, and the employment of
shafts, and the use of heat as an air-extracting force—these
means, have all commonly been combined in each barrack, for the
more certain attainment of the object in view, a constant and
sufficient pure air supply. But this is not all, the German bar-
racks have been generally so built, that they could be thrown
widely open on every side, during pleasant weather. The windows
of the Prussian regulation barracks were, on the south side, only
closed with canvas curtains, and in fact, frequently the sides of
these barracks were only built with a fixed covering, up to the
line of the window sills; the section remaining between this line
and the eaves, being occupied by moveable windows, curtains,
or hinged sections of wall. This arrangement made it possible
to thoroughly aerate the wards, as also to bring the fresh out-
door air to the beds of those who needed most its health-restoring
influence, but who were too feeble to have obtained it otherwise.
Not only were the German barracks so constructed as to be
opened freely on one or more sides, but the well-being of the
patients was often still more completely provided for, by the
erection of side galleries, and projecting verandahs, protected
and screened by canvas curtains, where the convalescent might
take exercise or repose, and even the sick not unfrequently be
treated with the very best results.
The system of winter ventilation employed in the Minden
and also in some of the Berlin barracks, was simple and excel-
lent. It seems to possess the great advantage over the American
1 It is to be regretted that bo many of the German barracks, erected during the
late war, wcro not designed to be used as winter hospitals. This was the case even
with the Tempelhofer Barracks at Berlin. Everybody at first supposed the war could
not last later than October, and the buildings were constructed accordingly. But
when cold weather came, the means found so excellent for securing a summer
ventilation—the open roof, windows, &c., had to be closed up, and even then, it was
often found difficult to keep the wards sufficiently warm. The patients consequently
suffered from both cold and bad air, and I am not surprised to learn that a number
of cases of gangrene, <fec. were reported during the winter in these Berlin barracks.
It is questionable if any advantage was derived from lifting the buildings so high—
many of them standing on piles quite eight feet above the ground. The sharp winter
wind blowing all around them, they were cold without necessarily being well
ventilated.
<pb>
system, whether as formerly applied or more recently modified,1
of maintaining a better distribution of warm and fresh air in
the ward.
One of the chief faults of the typical American pavilion, results
from its having walls of only a single thickness; it is conse-
quently liable to be excessively hot in the summer and exces-
sively cold in the winter. The walls of the German barracks, of
the best class, were generally formed of two or more coverings of
boards, enclosing one or two air-chambers; they were thus less
likely to leak, and the buildings were much more comfortable both
in winter and in summer. Perhaps the most formidable objection
urged against the use of wooden barracks, as well as tents, is the
imperfect protection they offer against the direct heat of the sun.
Barracks built of a single thickness of boards are certainly, during
the summer months, often intolerably hot. Partial relief may
be obtained by a free ridge ventilation, but the most effective
remedy for this special evil, is the addition of another wall, in such
a way as to envelope the ward with a thin cushion of air; and it
is not even necessary that the inner wall should form a solid par-
tition; if constructed of coarse oil-cloth, or even strong paper, it
often serves its purpose very satisfactorily. Paper is quite im-
permeable to air, is one of the best non-conductors of heat
known, is cheap, and easily applied as well as removed, and, for
these as well as other reasons, is perhaps the material best suited
for the doubling of walls in temporary barrack-hospitals. Indeed,
paper was extensively used for this purpose in the German
barracks, and particularly in order to prevent the entrance of
currents of air, and to increase their warmth during the winter.
This use of paper had previously been made, with the very best
results, at St. Petersburg, in converting summer barracks into
winter hospitals. Indeed, a knowledge of the use of paper, and
of cloth sized and painted, in the construction of inner walls and
ceilings, is one of the chief acquisitions relating to temporary
hospital construction, to which we are almost wholly indebted to
recent, and more particularly German experience.

Q
<pb>
HILE it must be confessed, not only that the general
provisions now made for the care of the sick and wounded
of armies are greatly superior to those which were for-
merly made, but that army hospital accommodations have been
increased and improved 'as well, the increase and improvement
have been almost entirely limited to those military hospitals
called in English "general hospitals," and which, if temporary,
are at least at the same time immovable or "fixed." It is
evident that such establishments can respond only partially to
the necessities of an active army. It is difficult to determine
where to establish them. It requires time to create them, often so
much that the necessity for such hospitals ceases before they are in
a condition to render any service. Armies often move away from
these hospitals such distances, as to make it only possible to
profit by them, by the transportation of the sick over long lines of
transit, at great cost and embarrassment to the administration, and
with fatigue and loss of life to the sick. Whatever advantages may
be derived from the organization of special hospitals for the sick
and disabled of armies in time of war, it is perfectly evident, that
so long as these establishments are fixed, they can only meet
in a partial way those needs for which they are nominally
created. To complete the hospital organization of an army,
something more is therefore required. It is necessary that the
means should exist for creating, within the lines of the army
itself, rapidly and whenever the occasion may demand it, hospital
accommodation for a large number of men. The need for such
accommodation is especially felt after engagements, which it is
often quite impossible to foresee, at least in so far as their
locality and importance are concerned. After great battles
thousands of wounded often become the subjects of our care; to
transport all these unfortunates back to the general hospitals in
the rear is commonly a physical impossibility. The consequence
is that large numbers of wounded must receive what care may
<pb>
be given to them, at least for a time, in the immediate vicinity
of the spot where they may have been wounded.
This fact has- been, as we have seen, so far recognized as to
have resulted in the establishment in all modern armies of a
service corresponding more or less completely with that known
in the French army as the ambulance service, and which has in
charge the organization and direction of the ambulant or field
hospitals.
While, however, military hospitals, both permanent and seden-
tary, have been all the while steadily improving—indeed, have
been so far perfected in their material organization, as to
fairly represent at the present time the most enlightened opinions
which have been advanced concerning the general subject of hos-
pitalization,—this can scarcely be said of the service which has
been created for the more immediate care of the wounded upon
the field. Its personal organization has generally been sadly
defective and insufficient for its office. Created to respond to no
well-defined idea of the true mission of such a service, it has
rarely exhibited any plan other than one which may have had
its origin in reasons of temporary and immediate expediency;
remote and contingent needs have seldom been considered, or if
once felt have been speedily forgotten. The consequence has
been, that those upon whom it has fallen to discharge the func-
tions of this service have too frequently been few in number, in
proportion to the work to be done, as well as feeble in authority
in view of its importance. There has been a want alike of men,
authority, and material; and this want still exists. The
surgeons, assistants, and stretcher-bearers for field duty, are not
more numerous or better disciplined in the French army to-day
than they were a hundred years ago ; and the material at the
disposition of a French ambulance corps is now scarcely greater
than it then was; nor have the resources of the field sanitary
service attached to any European army been in many important
respects perceptibly increased since a date equally remote. These
defects, however, are general, in so far as they are the results of
a constitution radically vicious; and I wish in this place to
direct your attention more particularly to a want which has
been especially felt by all—the want of shelter sufficient for the
<pb>
sick and wounded—who cannot, or ought not, to be transported
a long distance—and so established, as to realize the conditions
which experience has taught us were most favourable to health,
as well as recovery from disease or wounds.
Not only have few attempts been made to improve the con-
structions occupied by the field hospitals attached to European
armies, but few attempts have ever been made even to provide
special constructions suitable and sufficient for the requirements
of these most important establishments. We have seen what the
practice was in France, in the reign of Louis XIV., and how
according to the "Instruction" of D'Argenson " one was almost
always obliged to have recourse to barns." The methods adopted
in those days for hospitalizing the sick in the immediate vicinity
of armies, are those still most frequently practised.
Sick and wounded soldiers have been almost always crowded
together in such buildings as chance might offer in the immediate
vicinity of the camp or of the field of battle—in buildings not
only generally insusceptible of proper ventilation, but often
located in places unsuitable, as well from the presence of innu-
merable morbific agencies, as from the absence of the first condi-
tions of salubrity. Wounded soldiers who fall upon a European
battle-field are treated to-day almost precisely as they were a
hundred years ago—excepting only certain details of medical
and surgical treatment; and I am sorry to say that they are not
only treated in the same way, but that they die in the same way,
in nearly the same proportion, from the same causes—typhus,
gangrene, and purulent infection.
If the statistics of modern European field-surgery show results
somewhat better than those obtained during the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, it must be attributed principally to the fact,
that both private and public buildings .are better constructed
than formerly, as well as more carefully kept, while at the same
time the soldier himself is better clothed and fed; in a word, to
the generally improved conditions of living among all classes of
people at the present day.
Perhaps the most conclusive proof I could offer, that up
to the present time no systematic effort has been made to procure
suitable shelter for the sick and wounded of active armies in the
<pb>
field, is the fact that the word ambulance itself, now so well known
to all the world, does not suggest to those who most frequently
use it a building or even a shelter. It is a term which has been
generally employed to indicate a service. On consulting the
classical "Medical Dictionary" of Littre and Robin, we find
that an ambulance is "a temporary hospital establishment
(etablissement hospitalier) near an army corps"—that its per-
sonnel numbers thirty-four surgeons, assistants, and nurses,
and that its materiel is carried upon five waggons. What this
materiel is, we are not informed, although told that it is gene-
rally placed in "depot" in a sheltered spot, and "in the neigh-
bourhood of water." Legouest, however, in his "Traite de
Chirurgie d'Armee," informs us what this materiel may be, which
"is necessary to the service of the sick and wounded. In the
first place: the medicines, material for dressings, surgical instru-
ments, and various utensils; in the next place: the means of
transport." In sixty pages, of the twenty-second chapter of this
book, entitled "On the Medical Service in the Field," the medi-
cines, and the bandages, and the surgical instruments, and the
utensils, are enumerated with a detail that is almost painful; but
scarcely a word is to be found there which throws any light upon
the character of the installation of the ambulance itself. So, in
the voluminous reports of Chenu, upon the ambulances and mili-
tary hospitals established by the French during the Crimean War,
and in Italy, during the war of 1859, while the movements of the
armies, and the personal organization of the service de sante, and
the statistical results of wounds, are given in many respects with
the most satisfactory minuteness, I am unable to find any
detailed account of the dispositions which may have been taken
to secure for the sick and wounded the shelter they must have
required at the field ambulances, volantes and sedentaires.
The failure to allude to a subject of such importance in the
works I have referred to, would certainly seem very singular,
except it be presumed that the kind of shelter generally em-
ployed for the ambulance was too well known to make any
description of it necessary. This presumption was undoubtedly
entertained by these writers, as — in my belief—it had been
previously by nearly all their predecessors. The fact is simply
<pb>
this—from the earliest times down to the present time,
rarely, if ever, have systematic measures been taken to pro-
vide a special and sufficient shelter for the wounded, in the
immediate neighbourhood of armies, engaged in active hos-
tilities—the wounded have nearly always been carried from
the field to such convents, churches, private houses, or huts
as may have been nearest or most easy of access; and under
such cover as these constructions may have afforded, the ambu-
lances, both volantes and sidentaires, have generally been estab-
lished. Such having been the conventional method among all
armies of obtaining a locale for the ambulance, and a shelter for
the wounded, it has been evidently impossible to give the details
of an installation, the peculiarities of which must always have
been determined by the circumstances of time and place.
This method of obtaining shelter for the wounded possesses,
at least in Europe, certain advantages which are unfortunately
so evident as to conceal to a great extent the disadvantages
inherent to the system. Armies in Europe are seldom far distant
from cities and villages, where public and private buildings may
not be obtained to give shelter to considerable numbers of
wounded. The employment of such buildings for hospital pur-
poses saves to the State, not only the cost of constructions for
the ambulances, but also the cost and encombrement which their
transportation in the train of the army would inevitably occa-
sion. The immediate advantages to be derived by adopting the
custom of relying upon the country itself in which the war may
be conducted, for the shelter necessary for the wounded, are
therefore obvious; so much so, that unless we could show that
the system was attended by disadvantages, so serious as to be
more than commensurate, we should be ready to give it our
sanction as the best which could be adopted—one which, if it did
not entirely respond to the necessities of the individual soldier,
at least most completely protected the larger and more general
interests of the State.
A careful investigation of this system, however, will make
evident its many and great disadvantages. In the first place: it
subjects the medical department in the army to various conditions
which it alone should always be able to control. Such conditions
<pb>
as the absence of dampness, cleanliness, isolation from places
which may prove centres of infection, the supply of water, of
light, and, more than all, of air in proper quantities, are of alto-
gether too much consequence in the installation of an ambulance
to be determined by mere chance—the chance of their presence
in the constructions which may be found near the field of battle.
Indeed, it is very seldom that the surgeon is so fortunate as to
secure a building in which he can establish his ambulance, so
located and so arranged as to be entirely unobjectionable. In the
next place: such buildings are generally small and deficient
in number. It becomes as difficult to adapt them to meet
the requirements of sanitary science, as it does finally and
almost inevitably to prevent their becoming overcrowded and
infected.
The inconvenience, the suffering, and the loss of life, which
have been sustained by armies from the insufficiency of the
shelter provided for the wounded are almost incredible. Larrey,
speaking of the condition of the wounded after the battle of
Eylau, says:—" I had in the morning established an ambulance
in some barns on the left side of the road entering the town, but
unfortunately they were open on all sides, the straw which
had covered them having been taken off for the horses. We were
forced to lay our wounded upon what was left of this straw
sprinkled with snow, and a large number both from the guard
and the line were brought together under this miserable
cover. . . . The cold was so intense that the instruments
dropped frequently from the hands of my aides. ... A great
part of the soldiers of the army had been operated upon, and had
had their wounds dressed within the first twelve hours; it was
only then that we were able to take a little repose. We passed
the rest of the night upon the frozen snow around the bivouac
fire of the ambulance. Never had I passed so painful a day—
never had my soul been so deeply moved. I had been unable
to repress my tears at moments when I sought to sustain the
courage of my wounded. I was unhappily compelled to see a
number of these unfortunates die because of the pitiful circum-
stances of our position—the excessive cold and the want of a
locale. The impossibility of bringing together all the wounded
<pb>
French, as well as those of the enemy, in that little town (Eylau),
where the whole Mat-major of the army and of the imperial
guard were lodged; the danger of witnessing the outbreak of an
epidemic, from the piling together of these unfortunates, and the
abundant suppuration which must take place after the third day;
and, finally, our extreme penury, in an open country covered
with snow, abandoned by its inhabitants, and stripped of every
resource,—these were so many reasons which imperatively de-
manded an evacuation."1
According to Gama:—" Six days after the battle of Eylau the
wounded who had gone themselves or been carried to Thorn,
five leagues distant, were in a condition as deplorable as during
the first hours after the battle. I had assigned me, as chief of
service, nearly eight hundred of these people, whom I found in a
great house, lying on dung rather than straw, crowded together
one against the other, shrieking, weeping, and complaining of
having been abandoned—asking for death even; for in the midst
of these tortures existence was no longer a benefit. I succeeded
after a few days, assisted only by two or three sub-aides, in giving
to this place an aspect somewhat less disgusting—in alleviating
in a measure these great sufferings—in creating an atmosphere
less corrupt than that, which had been infected by the emana-
tions arising from purulent matter and the ordure in which
those poor soldiers who were unable to move were lying. With-
out the assistance of the iconome, who had been replaced by a
clerk, only charged, as it appeared, with the accounts—with but
two or three' infermiers, unacquainted with their duties—not a
place where broth could be made, for more than twenty-five men
—without boilers, which could be used out of doors—without
vessels, in which drinks might be served to the men, tormented
by an inextinguishable thirst from the fever of their wounds—
destitute of assistance, destitute of means—unable to find a
person with whom I might concert some plan for getting out
of the difficulty—forced to make use of the fragments of am-
bulance caissons for dressings, and even these insufficient,—such
1 "Memoires de Chirurgie Militaire," de D. J. Larrey. Paris, 1812; tome iii.
pp. 38, 39, 42, 43.
<pb>
were the arrangements made for the care of the soldiers of
Napoleon!"'
In speaking of the Russian campaign, the same writer says:—
"As for the help which is demanded after battles, and which
the overwhelming fatigues of long marches render equally neces-
sary, where were the hospitals which the administration took
care to establish—even to trace out at long distances the line of
evacuation, which was so necessary, up to the Prussian frontier?
There was not one. The hospital at Wilna, and those of Moscow,
where the sick and wounded French were received, did not
belong to the army; and, although M. Larrey may call
'hospitals,' the houses and barracks where he left sick men and
surgeons, when going as well as returning, this name cannot be
applied to them. A place where everything is wanting, some-
times even water, where surgeons, after having used their own
under-clothing, are obliged to take that of the wounded for
dressings; where one is compelled to think himself fortunate in
being able to procure old paper, pieces of parchment, and
carpeting, to be used for compresses and fracture bandages, is not
a hospital, it is only a miserable sink in which the wounded are
heaped up to die. The administration was unmoved by these
pressing necessities; it did not even occupy itself with them,
except, perhaps, when everything was quiet and its aid came too
late. On the retreat it left behind the surgeons, among soldiers
overwhelmed with grief; and it left them to console their patients
as best they might, without means and without other resources
than those which their ingenuity might discover in the most inde-
scribable things which fell into their hands, as also, exhausted—
worn out with fatigue, and pushing to the end what was left
of presence of mind, of activity, and courage—to die in their
turn."2
Indeed, scarcely a great battle occurred during the history of
the Consulate and the First Empire which was not followed by
scenes of wretchedness, arising from the complete inadequacy
of the available shelter, in no respect less painful than those
which furnished the occasion for these graphic sketches.

<pb>
The only possible remedy was an evacuation of the wounded
upon the towns and cities most accessible, but often quite distant,
and which never could be effected without seriously compro-
mising the chances of recovery in every case where a severe
wound had been received. A decree1 regulating the French
ambulance service had directed the immediate transfer of the
wounded from the place of first dressing (" ambulance volante"),
to the " dep&t d'ambulance " (head-quarters of the "ambulance
volante "), established just behind the centre of the army; from
this place they were to be sent on as rapidly as possible to
the first "h6pital s&lentaire ;" from which, to prevent over-
crowding, a sufficient number were to be evacuated on to
the sedentary hospital next farthest removed, and so on
back, if necessary, to the first permanent military hospital.
The wounded were therefore theoretically constantly en route.
From the enormous burdens of such a service upon the trans-
portation of an army, it is evident that it must have been,
generally, most inefficiently accomplished. These evacuations
of the wounded from the immediate neighbourhood of the
field of battle, accordingly, seldom failed to occasion their accu-
mulation in such numbers, at what were considered the most
favourable points, as to produce the outbreak of pyohemic
epidemics, often of a formidable character; as, for example, at
Briinn, a city upon which the wounded at Austerlitz were evacu-
ated, where the epidemic assumed such violence as to extend to
the civil population of the city, and finally to invade the whole
line of evacuation quite back to France.
The cruel results of over-crowding and long transportation—
typhus and hospital gangrene—induced Vaidy, a surgeon of the
First Empire, to propose the treatment of the wounded in pro-
visional barracks established in the open air. In an article pub-
lished in 1818 in the "Dictionnaire des Sciences Medicales," he
says:—" Since in those large gatherings of men, such as armies occa-
sion, it is physically impossible to respect all the rules of hygiene,
it is the duty of those charged to watch over the health of their
1 Axrfite du 24 thermidor, an viii. titre ler, 6me sec. See " Legislation Militaire,"
par H. Berriat. Alexandrie, 1812; tome iv. pp. 2, 3, et seq.
<pb>
fellow-citizens, to remedy the evils which necessarily result from
these dangerous gatherings. Inasmuch, therefore, as they are
productive of a great deal of sickness, instead of crowding the
sick together in the hospitals of towns, where they may carry with
them the germs of a fatal contagion, it would be expedient to
create establishments large and well aired in the open country.
These buildings should be constructed of wood, boarded up on
the outside, and lined on the inside with fresh straw — to
be frequently renewed. Such barracks would serve very
advantageously as asylums for the sick coming from the army,
while they would be for the people upon whom the scourge of
the war might fall, a happy guarantee that they should not see
typhus, one of the most deadly diseases which men have to fear,
developed among them."
Vaidy was induced to make this suggestion principally by a
desire to avoid, or at least mitigate, the several evils incident to
long transportations. By the establishment of special hospitals
in the rear of the army, not far removed from it, these objects
could be in a certain measure secured. But, at the time he
wrote, the importance of making any special provision for the
shelter of either sick or wounded was rarely entertained, and
thus, the wise and humane suggestions of Vaidy were for a long
time unheeded.
At the outbreak of the Crimean War, one of the first military
movements being into the Dobrudscha, a country of arid plains,
steppes, and marshes, inhabited only by a few shepherds, and
destitute of all resources, the Russian and Turkish armies suf-
fered severely from a mortality among their sick, occasioned as
much from the absence of cover as from a want of food. And the
French themselves very shortly after suffered even more severely
from a similar cause.
"We established," says Chenu, "at Gallipoli (April 5, 1854) a
provisional hospital in some Turkish houses—no better place could
be found—although the hospitalization was so bad as to render it
necessary to abandon the place as the weather grew warm." 1 The
cholera broke out here early in July:—" That infected mass of
1 Chenu, " Rapport au Conseil de Sante des Armees." Paris, 1865; p. 14.
<pb>
houses in the midst of filth of every kind, which the indolence of
the people of the country had left to fester at the corners of the
streets, and on the door-sills of the dwellings, seemed an auda-
cious defiance thrown at the epidemic. The hospitals filled up,
and graves were dug in silence around the camps. The living
of to-day were the dead of to-morrow." 1
The disastrous consequences to the allied armies during the
Crimean campaign, from having neglected to procure suitable
and sufficient shelter for the sick, independent of such as might
be found in the country in which they were to operate, were not
limited to the period of the cholera epidemic at Gallipoli and at
Varna. On landing at Eupatoria in September, the English
troops bivouacked without cover and without fire; and, exposed
the first night to a rain which poured in torrents, were compelled
to re-embark immediately, on shipboard, fifteen hundred of their
sick.2 At the Alma the same want was severely felt, as it was,
perhaps, even still more severely during the whole of the terrible
first winter before Sebastopol. For quite two months after a land-
ing in the Crimea had been effected, the only means possessed by
a large number of regiments for sheltering their sick and wounded
were those afforded by "a single bell-tent." It has rarely happened
that an army has entered upon an autumnal campaign so com-
pletely destitute of suitable shelter, and if the complaints of those
upon whom the responsibility of caring for the sick principally
fell were frequent and bitter, the suffering from cold, rain, and
exposure, as the season advanced, was almost incredible. On the
1st of January, 1855, Chenu said of the English army:—" It num-
bered at the commencement of this campaign 54,000 men, its
strength to-day is but 27,000, and half this number are on the
sick list."3 The mortality in the English army was, indeed, so
fearful at this time as not only to profoundly impress public
opinion in Great Britain, but to cause the government at once to
resolve upon energetic and effective measures of relief. A few
months after, the English army was well supplied with clothing

<pb>
and food, while the sick were sheltered in comfortable framed
barracks, which had been sent out from England, instead of half
buried in the earth in the taupinieres which the country alone
furnished.
But if the English field hospitals were well established and
maintained, during the middle and latter periods of the siege, the
same could hardly be said of many of the French ambulances.
'Whoever may have been at Sebastopol, can hardly fail to re-
member the troglodytic caves everywhere to be seen along the
line of the naked rocky hills which shut in that city. These
afforded during the siege a convenient cover to the Russian
and allied tirailleurs; they were used, however, for other pur-
poses. "Two of these grottoes," says Baudens, "taken from the
Russians in the ravine of the Carenage, and the Karabelna'ia,
served as ambulances for the trenches on the right. They were
out of the reach of shot fired in a direct line, but more than one
bomb came rolling into the ravine, to burst and make victims at
the entrances of these pitiful retreats of misery. The uncertain
light, which entered by the crooked galleries, rendered surgical
operations difficult. During the night, that the enemy's attention
might not be drawn to us, we were contented with one little
lamp suspended overhead. The continual dull roar of the
cannonade was, at intervals, dominated by screams of birds of
prey, who, disturbed in their peaceful haunts, sailed down from
the rocks above to carry back with them shreds of human flesh.
After the fall of Sebastopol, it was a pious custom to visit these
grottoes, full of sad souvenirs; there was shown the straw
bedding, still bloody, where the surgeon had kneeled down to
extract a ball or stop a hemorrhage. Who shall ever tell all the
sad and touching scenes which passed there? In these ambu-
lances the open wounds, and broken limbs, received the first
dressing; the blood which flowed in abundance was checked by
hasty expedients; many entered only to die after cruel suffering
with heroic courage; the others were carried into the division
ambulances."1 The division ambulance which received most of
the wounded from the place just described, was established at the
1 Baudens, "Souvenir d'une Mission Me'dicale en Crimee." Paris, 1857; pp. 36,37.
<pb>
entry of the ravine of the Carenage, under the shelter of some
barracks and tents; but the barracks were by no means well
constructed, while the tents, made of loosely woven stuff, per-
mitted the rain to sift through, and unprovided with any suitable
heating apparatus, became so thoroughly uncomfortable, when the
weather grew cold, as to be abandoned as fast as it was possible
to replace them with barracks.
We find, moreover, that recourse was constantly had, in the
Crimea, to those forced evacuations of the wounded, from both
ambulances and hospitals, to which I have already alluded, and
which have been one of the curses of the French ambulance
system, since the time of its adoption—what they always have
been, and always will be, to every system which abandons the
sheltering of those who may fall wounded upon the field to the
caprice of chance. Says Chenu:—" Even after the establishment
of these hospitals, (at Constantinople and in its vicinity, in 1855-6,)
it was necessary to have recourse to an extreme measure, but one
demanded by the circumstances, that of evacuating the inmates
of these hospitals, from one to the other, back to France. The
result was—our hospitals served scarcely any other purpose
than that of hotels, where the sick stopped for a few days, more
or less, before a similar repose at Gallipoli, and afterwards at
Nagara, and so on to France. This measure, considered indis-
pensable, had its good side, but it is suggestive of many serious
reflections. If it may be employed in the case of certain diseases,
in a word, for the sick who are really transportable, it is not the
same for most of the wounded, the recently amputated, and those
exhausted by the incessant calls of diarrhoea and dysentery.
Nevertheless, it was necessary to face these necessities, and if I
must say it, we did all we could, although we did very badly." 1
M. Dunant informs us that at Solferino, in 1859, just before
the commencement of the battle, "the ambulances volantes had
been established in the private houses, granges, churches, and
convents in the neighbourhood, or even under the trees in the
open air. From these places the wounded were sent to the
1 Chenu, "Rapport au Conseil de Suite' des Armees." Paris, 1865; p. 708.
<pb>
nearest villages or hamlets. In these little country towns,
churches, convents, houses, public places, courts, streets, and
promenades—all, were occupied as provisional ambulances. . . .
At Castiglione, the hospital, the cloister, the caserne San Luigi,
the caserne of the gendarmes, as well as the churches Maggiore,
San Giuseppe, and Santa Rosalia were filled with the wounded,
crowded together and lying only on straw. Straw had also
been put in the streets, courts, and squares, wherever, here and
there, under boards or awnings, a cover had been set up to pro-
tect against the sun the wounded who were coming in, all at
once, from every side. The private houses even were soon filled
up. What were the agonies and sufferings of those days—the
25th, 26th, and 27th of June? The wounds inflamed by the heat,
dust, and the want of water, as well as of care, became more
painful, and the air grew corrupt from mephitic exhalations, in
spite of the praiseworthy efforts of the intendance to maintain
proper sanitary conditions, in the places which had been trans-
formed into ambulances. Upon the flagstones of the churches
and hospitals of Castiglione, had been placed side by side men
of all nations, French, Arabs, Germans, and Sclaves. Some, who
had been provisionally pushed down to the lower ends of the
chapels, had lost all power of moving, or were unable to move, on
account of the narrowness of the place they occupied. The
vaults of these sanctuaries rang with oaths, blasphemies, and
cries, which no words can express. Certain soldiers, imagining
that the cold water which was poured upon their wounds, already
purulent, caused maggots, refused to have their bandages moist-
ened, others, who had been fortunate enough to have had their
wounds dressed upon the field, were not cared for, during their
forced detention at Castiglione, and the dressings tightened by
the jolting of transportation, neither removed nor loosened even,
were productive of veritable tortures .... At one of these
churches more than 500 soldiers lay in heaps, and there were at
least quite 100, in addition, stretched upon the straw in front
of the church, and under some awnings which had been set up to
keep the sun off." 1

At Langensalza in 1866, "no one was prepared," says Dr.
Evans, "for so terrible a carnage; the hospital service was want-
ing not only in nurses, but, strange to say, it did not even possess
the necessary material for arranging a single ambulant hospital;
so the wounded Hanoverians and Prussians were placed upon
such straw as could be hastily procured; some even were laying
upon the ground; few were they to whom a bed furnished with
a straw mattress had been given." 1
The sufferings of the wounded during the recent war, at Sedan
and at Metz, and on the Loire, are almost too well known to make
them the occasion for a special notice. The French army was in
no way prepared to take the field when war was declared in July,
1870. The intendance was consequently at once overwhelmed
with multitudinous orders, which concerned rather the equip-
ment of the troops and their maintenance in the field, than an
enlargement of the resources to be placed at the disposition of
the service de santL Time, moreover, was wanting, as the work
of weeks and months had to be crowded into days. Something
also was expected from the different associations which had been
organized since several years, with a view to co-operate with the
service de saute in the work of battle-field relief. To what ex-
tent these circumstances may have led to the insufficiency of the
material and the means of caring for the sick and wounded in
the French army, during the late war, it is not necessary here to
inquire. The only fact which now concerns us is this: wherever
a large number of wounded had to be taken care of, they had to
be taken care of in the old way, under such cover as was most
available. An English surgeon, writing from Sedan, Sept. 5,
says:—" Here in the hospital, within one hundred yards of the
battle-field, we are in a bad way; what we want are tents and
beds." An agent of the English Aid Society, writing from
Arlon on the 6th of the same month, says:—" The condition of
things at the front is very bad, not only are there wounded
in enormous numbers without bedding, but without even suf-
ficient nourishment, there is also dysentery, diarrhoea, and fever."

<pb>
another writer says:—" The villages of Remilly and Douzy are
crammed with wounded, one small chateau outside the latter
village has 900 wounded in it, and all the other houses are pro-
portionally full. It is sad to think of the hundreds who might
be saved with a little care."
Is it surprising that under such circumstances, pyaemia and
typhus should have soon broken out, in almost all these villages,
with a violence such as has seldom been witnessed except in the
records of ancient surgery? At Metz the state of things was, if
possible, even worse. The whole city became a vast ambulance
after the battles of the 14th, 16th, 17th and 18th of August. Not-
withstanding almost every building, public and private, had been
filled with the sick and wounded, places for them were still want-
ing, and hundreds of these unfortunates were finally crowded
into the cars of cattle trains, which were brought into the "Place
Royale " to be organized into an ambulance. The sanitary con-
dition of the city was most deplorable, long before it had suffered
from the privations incident to the siege.
M. Gallard, inspector of the transportation service for the sick
and wounded of the army of the Loire, says:—" The morning
after the first occupation of Orleans by the Prussians .... I
went with three of my assistants to Vierzon, where I thought of
organizing a system of caring for the wounded, in anticipation of
the military events which seemed imminent in Sologne. As the
resources of the city were very limited, it seemed to me quite
natural to ask the intendance to assist me in establishing a fixed
ambulance or temporary hospital, the creation of which appeared
to me indispensable. Feeling authorized as I did to make this de-
mand, from the instructions I had received from the Interna-
tional Society and the intendant-en-chef of the army of the
Loire, the short and categorical refusal which I received sur-
prised me very much, I must confess; but what surprised me
more, were the reasons assigned for the refusal. The principal
one was, that there was no need of thinking about preparing
ambulances in view of eventualities which might never occur;
that even should there be a great battle, such ambulances would
be much less useful than I supposed, for it would only be
necessary to take one of the car houses at the railway station,
R
<pb>
and throw 200 bundles of straw on the ground, to be able to
receive all the wounded, who would there find themselves 'perfectly
well provided for." M. Gallard was naturally very indignant, that
anyone should coolly propose such a system for treating those who
might fall wounded in defending their country; and obtaining
the aid of a citizen of the town, he established there a small ambu-
lance of thirty beds :—" But this was indeed very little, for the
hospital being filled up and the private houses invaded, we
found, according to the wish of my interlocutor, more than 200
sick lying upon the straw. This crowding together had been
occasioned, not by the wounded, for there had been no serious
fighting in the neighbourhood, but by the sick, of whom we never
think enough, although experience has shown that in all long cam-
paigns, there are at least nine times as many sick as wounded.
There were in this place unfortunates down with small-pox in the
suppurative stage, those sick with typhoid and dysentery in its
worst forms, and who could not be undressed from a want of sheets
and blankets. How many died in the midst of this rottenness,
I do not wish to find out; I will only say that if the ambulances,
which were refused me, had been organized, if the transport
service had worked regularly and orderly, all these sick
would have received in season the care which they failed
to get, and which, in spite of the devotion of the inhabit-
ants of Vierzon, it was impossible to give them, from the want
of sufficient material resources." 1 And during this same cam-
paign some English gentlemen attached to the fifth ambulance
(of the " Societe de Secours aux Blesses") speak of the wounded
having been lodged in school houses, the outbuildings of farms,
and private houses:—" At L'Echelles many were in barns, where
at night sheep or cattle were driven in to the adjoining sheds, to keep the
patients as warm as we could. They almost buried themselves in
the straw during the very cold weather. We had great difficulty
in keeping good ventilation," &c.2

If I have been induced to make these citations it has been for
the purpose of furnishing you with the unequivocal evidence of
the truth of my assertion—that since a century there has been
on the part of the principal European States, no augmentation of
the means wherewith to furnish shelter to the sick and wounded,
within the lines of their armies—that as formerly, so now, armies
are sent into the field unprovided with the material necessary for
the establishment of ambulances, although such an establishment
may be imperatively required, either from the absence of build-
ings near the field of battle, or their unsuitableness, or complete
insufficiency, for the shelter of the multitudes who may have
been suddenly stricken down in the fearful collisions of a great
battle. I have also wished to represent to you, in the words of
those who themselves have witnessed the scenes they have
described, the pitiful and often heartrending consequences of
this secular official improvidence.
Few are the persons who, familiar with the hardships the
soldier has to face, and with the death-rate in the ambulances,
far exceeding that common in our civil hospitals,1 although the
soldier has in his favour the vigour of his age, may not have
often asked if there was no remedy for this scourge—if it was
not possible to modify and improve the hospitalization of active
armies? These questions, as we have seen, have been almost
always answered practically in the negative. Public and private
ventilation under the circumstances mentioned, but it is certainly surprising that
any one should have had recourse, as late as 1870-71, to the system of warming the
wards of hospitals alluded to—the system of overcrowding simple, if not pure—inas-
much as animals (cattle), when present in an apartment, vitiate the atmosphere and
render it unfit for respiration, even more rapidly than would the same number of
men.

buildings have not only been constantly used for the shelter of
the sick, but they have almost universally been considered as the
best places in which to establish ambulances or temporary hos-
pitals, whenever or wherever they could be obtained. If at any
time provisions may have been made to provide the service de sante
with shelter for the wounded, other than this, it has been for the
purpose of meeting the possible contingency of the absence of
buildings at the seat of war, rather than for the purpose of estab-
lishing a hospitalization which might respond more completely
to the requirements of modern hygiene; and such provisional
shelter has generally not only been considered inferior to that
furnished by permanent constructions, but its transportation has
always been regarded as a heavy burden, to be abandoned, either
wholly or partially, on every possible occasion. Although, since
the beginning of this century, the common roads of Europe have
been replaced by McAdam highways—uniting all the important
strategic points—which have more recently been superseded by
lines of railway, along which armies may be transported in a few
days such distances as, formerly, could only be traversed in
weeks or even months, the word impedimenta still disturbs the
repose of a European quartermaster, as much as it did in ancient
times that of a Roman quaestor making ready for a campaign
into Germany or Africa. I know that it is almost useless to
represent the advantages to be derived by supplying an army
with any system of portable hospitals, as we are very sure to
be informed that the system is impracticable, that the baggage of
an army is already an excessive burden upon it, and that any
increase in its means of transportation would be most prejudicial.
But whatever may be the inconveniences of transporting the
material necessary for the construction of field hospitals, it is
perfectly evident that they are much less than those resulting
from the constant decimation of armies insufficiently provisioned
in this respect. For example, one third of the whole French
army in the Crimea was destroyed each year by disease alone;
to maintain its full strength, nearly seventy thousand men had
to be taken annually from France, each man representing a por-
tion of the wealth of the country, each drawing upon the public
treasury for his support, and each one to be transported to the
<pb>
seat of war, at a cost of not less than — francs. Suppose a
proper outfit for the hospital department at the opening of the
campaign had enabled it to reduce the mortality twenty-five
per cent, which is a very modest supposition, would the cost
and impediment of such an outfit have been an equivalent for
the expense and loss to the State occasioned by the annual
expedition of a new force of nearly twenty thousand men?
The humanitarian arguments in favour of my proposition I
leave purposely out of view, as it is generally useless to bring
before the tribunal of sentiment those questions which always
have been, and always will be, settled in such a way as may
seem to accord best with the interests of the administration,
rather than with those of the individual.
It is certainly remarkable that the impracticability of reform-
ing the hospitalization of active armies should still be entertained,
at a time when the value of human life was never more highly
estimated, and when the laws of sanitary science as applied to
the health of civil populations, were never more carefully con-
sidered or more universally respected. Moreover, the civil
population is only occasionally or partially subjected to the
evils arising from an insufficient shelter, or the imperfect ventila-
tion of hospitals—dangers to which armies are constantly exposed;
dangers which, if alike in kind to each class of the population,
are certainly not alike in degree; while the claims of the soldier
to profit by all the ameliorations which science or humanity may
discover, to prevent disease and death, are as much greater than
those which can be presented in behalf of the civilian, as the peril
he must meet is greater and the cause he serves more sacred.
Unfortunately, certain facts valuable in their relations to
science, to humanity—in the broadest sense of that word—seem
destined to remain for ever sterile. They appear never to have
known the fertile touch of some strong conviction of their worth
and excellence, which might quicken the life within them, and
force it to contribute to the general movement and the welfare of
the world. How important it is to do this or that thing—to
avoid this or that peril, may even be admitted; but the thing is
neither done nor the peril avoided. If it be asked why, no one
is able to give a satisfactory answer.
<pb>
The dangers which an army, entering upon a campaign, incurs
by being imperfectly equipped and provisioned, have often been
pointed out. It was a maxim, even among the Romans, that a
want often wastes an army more than fighting—" Ssepius enim
penuria quam pugna consumit exercitum."1 And in modern
times scarcely a campaign has been lost, rarely has a great mili-
tary disaster occurred, which could not be attributed in a measure
to the inadequacy of the supplies, or which may not have been
greatly aggravated by the insufficiency of the means for pre-
serving the health of the soldier. Indeed, of all the wants which
ever may have imperilled the force of an army, the most fre-
quently occurring, as well as the greatest one, has been the
want of suitable means of shelter, and more particularly for
those who have been worn and exhausted by the fatigues of
active service.
If such have been the uniformly fatal consequences of an insuf-
ficient provision for the organization of field hospitals, the question
must continually recur—Is it not possible to make a larger and more
complete provision? The answer which I should most unhesitat-
ingly now give is—Yes. An arrangement should and could be
made, in every army, for the establishment of a certain number of
field tent-hospitals, and the number should be sufficient for the
treatment of all the sick and severely wounded, who cannot safely
be transported long distances. Whatever may be the good quali-
ties of barracks, even those most hastily constructed often require
too much time for their construction to be of service, and finally,
and principally, they are non-portable. If armies are to be
followed by hospitals, such hospitals must be established under
tents. Tents are portable, are neither heavy nor bulky, and can
be carried in the train of an army without encumbering it. A
single waggon can easily carry the shelter required for a tent-
hospital of eighty or a hundred beds. Such a hospital can be
put up in an hour, in the most suitable and best place, and
exactly when as well as where it is needed. Tent shelter costs
less than most kinds of special shelter for the sick. In short,
it is not more expensive than other kinds of shelter, while it is
the only special shelter which can be employed for ambulant
1 Vegelius " De Re Militari;" lib. iii. c. 3.
<pb>
hospitals. Fortunately it happens that it is precisely that kind
of shelter, which experience has proved to be better than any
other for the organization of temporary hospitals, from a strictly
sanitary point of view; it exposes the smallest amount of
material to infection, and is capable of the completest and most
constant ventilation.
I have elsewhere spoken at length of the great importance of
pure air in the treatment of the sick, and have endeavoured to
show how necessary it is, that measures be taken that the air
of apartments occupied by the sick may be kept fresh by an ample
ventilation. I have also spoken of some of the special means
which at different times have been taken to maintain a fair degree
of atmospheric purity within hospitals. I then had occasion to
state, that one of the great advantages which temporary con-
structions possess over permanent constructions, is the facility
with which systems of natural ventilation can be applied to
them. If they afford a less perfect shelter against the in-
clemency of the weather—rain and frost, this apparent defect is
usually more than compensated for, by the advantage here
alluded to. Pure air is even of more consequence than shelter
itself, so that by exchanging a certain amount of shelter for a
certain amount of fresh air, oftentimes a most profitable exchange
can be made. Indeed, the amount of shelter which can often be
dispensed with, advantageously, is vastly greater than is even
now generally supposed. I have already mentioned certain
instances in which the sick have been forced to occupy quarters
which were supposed at the time to be quite unfit to receive
them, on account of their imperfect and shattered condition, but
where it was found that the proportion of recoveries was much
greater, than among those treated within the shelter of substan-
tial walls. Occasionally, the sick have been compelled to pass a
considerable portion of the day quite unprotected by any
shelter, and yet so far from having suffered, in mild seasons and
climates, they appear to have been almost uniformly bene-
fited by the seeming exposure. Thus, it is said that:—" In
1782, early in the summer following the surrender of Yorktown,
the French army left Southern Virginia, where the heat had
become insupportable. The sick conveyed upon the waggons of
<pb>
the ambulance train, continuing on the march and halting with
the army, had nearly all got well on their arrival in Pennsylvania,
a few only remained, and these were convalescents. And this
experience," the writer intelligently observes, " was not at that
time sufficiently taken into consideration, but was soon for-
gotten." 1
At a meeting of the Academie des Sciences, held in June,
1871, General Morin read an extract from a letter which he had
received a few days before from General L'Heriller, in which
that officer referred to a remarkable instance, which came within
his own knowledge, of the good effects of the open air upon the
sick.
During the Mexican expedition, twelve soldiers fell sick with
typhus contracted by occupying a house just abandoned by the
Liberals, who were being decimated by that disease; as it was
impossible to leave these soldiers behind, they were placed on
litters and put on the backs of mules, and thus followed the
movements of the command. Au bivouac, they were put under
tents, quite in the open air. Instead of growing more ill, every
one of these patients recovered, and not a new case was declared.
And General L'Heriller very justly concludes as follows:—" In
my opinion the only way to avoid typhus in hospitals, and in
large armies, is to make use of provisional hospitals alone. . .
I may add, in support of what I have just said, that in the
Crimea we were obliged, from the number who fell sick with
typhus, to put them under tents. These tents were almost con-
stantly open. The rain, snow, and frost, penetrated within
them; the men lay on rugs in their clothes. Well ! in spite of
these conditions, certainly to be deplored, we lost proportionally
less sick thus sheltered, than in the wooden barracks, which were
literally infected, I might almost say injected, with putrid
miasms."2
But were I to introduce here the results of recent experience,
I might multiply these observations almost indefinitely.

tionnaire Encyclopedique des Sciences Me'dicales;" art. Camp.

<pb>
If there is a principle of sanitary science well established at the
present time, it is that no shelter can be considered as suitable
for the sick, which, while affording a sufficient protection against
the inclemency of the weather, is not susceptible of a constant
and abundant aeration. Facts which I shall present in another
part of this Report have proved, I think, quite beyond question,
that tents afford to the sick all the protection against unfavour-
able atmospheric influences which is necessary, not only in the
summer, but also in the winter in temperate climates. Facts, no
less conclusive, have shown that it is much easier to assure a
sufficient and unfailing supply of fresh air to the inmates of tents
than to those dwelling in ordinary constructions.
In the hospitalization of the sick of armies, we have certainly
made great progress, we have improved our permanent military
hospitals; we have multiplied and improved our sedentary tem-
porary hospitals. We have still, however, a great evil for which
to find a remedy, the suffering and waste of life occasioned by the
enormous accumulations of sick and wounded in camps, and on
fields of battle—in houses and hovels, and buildings totally unfit
to serve as hospitals—with the alternative and consequence of a
hurried evacuation or transportation to far distant hospitals of
men seriously ill with painful diseases, or who may have been
grievously wounded. And these transportations are often abso-
lutely forced by the absence of all means of hospitalization within
the army itself.
Says Dr. Sutherland:—" But while admitting that large build-
ings may be improved if there be time for doing so, it must be
stated that no more disastrous idea can take possession of men's
minds than that sick and maimed people ought, on grounds of
humanity, to be packed into churches, barracks, and other un-
prepared buildings, with as little delay as possible. This error
has slain its tens of thousands in all wars. Even in specially
constructed and well managed civil surgical hospitals, every
surgeon knows how difficult it is, with all his care, to preveng
the invasion of hospital diseases. In extemporized war hospitals
they have been too often invited to enter.
"It is time that more rational ideas on subjects of this import-
ance should prevail, and it would well become aid societies to turn
<pb>
their attention not only to improved ambulances (waggons), but
to simpler methods of obtaining wholesome shelter for wounded men,
at a safe and convenient distance from battle-fields, until their
wounds have progressed so far as to admit of the sufferers being
removed into properly appointed hospitals at a distance. . . .
"There is evidence that during the late war agglomerations of
wounded into what is called 1 a hospital' have been as destructive
of life as ever. It would be far better and safer to place
wounded men, as a rule, in detached dwelling houses, or under a
canvas roof, or any similar shelter, sloping from a barrack or
church wall, rather than to take them inside."1
Baron Larrey has recently observed:—" The question of
employing tents and tent-barracks is of much importance, and it
seems to have been judged to-day, by an experimental trial, the
most complete as well as the most favourable. We have seen,
especially in these recent times of disaster, what services have
been rendered by the numerous ambulances attached to the
hospitals, and we have seen how important it was, in the presence
of a constantly increasing affluence of sick and wounded, to
prevent over-crowding and infection, by dissemination and in-
creasing the number of our provisional asylums." 2
Would that these opinions might have their just weight among
those who have the power to organize reform!
Says Dr. Sutherland:—"What appears to be most required
now-a-days in field work, is ingenuity in turning everything to
account for affording shelter and comfort to wounded men at a
safe distance from (near) the battle-field. Sufficient has been
stated to show an absolute necessity for some understanding
being come to regarding improvements in the hygiene of belli-
gerent military hospitals." 3
I have frequently had occasion to allude to the evil conse-
quences of an indiscriminate evacuation of the sick and wounded
upon remote hospitals, but the evacuation of the sick is often a

<pb>
salutary measure, and one so immediately connected with every
system of army hospital organization as to demand a more
serious consideration in this connection.
It is generally believed, and the belief is a result of experience,
that most of the seriously sick as well as a large proportion of
the wounded, can with safety, and perhaps even with advantage
to themselves, be conveyed to hospitals situated far in the rear
of the army. It is well known, that one of the most powerful
and effective restorative agencies, when disease exists, is found
in a complete change of air, climate, and surroundings. And
among the sick of armies, in a vast multitude of cases, the
benefits to be derived from such a change have been found to
more than counterbalance the evils incident to the transport.
By the dispersion of the sick, foci of pestilence and death are
often broken up; while the sick, disseminated through the
country, are thereby, less exposed to invasions of hospitalism in
any of its forms. Moreover, at points distant from the army,
the hospital service, as a whole, can always be established on a
more perfect footing than within the army itself. The sick
can be made more comfortable in a material point of view,
can be better supplied with general and special food, and be-
come the subjects of more direct personal attention. These
facts are well known, and when conjoined with the advan-
tages to be derived from disencumbering the army of its
sick and disabled, we are led to affirm that, as a rule, whether
a greater or a lesser number of sick are transported, or are trans-
ported a longer or a shorter distance, will depend largely upon
the material means of transportation possessed by the adminis-
tration, as also conversely, that the transport material will
usually be increased quite in proportion as the advantages to
be derived from transporting and evacuating the sick, appear to
be real and important.
If the medical history of the American War of the Rebellion
is valuable from the confirmation which it has given to certain
principles of hospital construction, it is certainly scarcely less so,
from having shown what immense services might be rendered
by a large dispersion of the sick through the country, and by a
transport service organized upon a scale wholly unprecedented
<pb>
in the military history of any State. Convoys of sick were con-
stantly being sent from every military department, by steam-
boats and railways, to be disseminated amongst the general hos-
pitals of the Northern States, from which, after a few weeks, the
majority of the sick were returned to then- regiments " fit for
duty." The total number of those thus sent back and returned
to the army, during the war, was enormous; and no fact is more
universally believed by army medical officers in the United States,
than that had the sick not thus been sent out of the "field,"
"post," and "departmental" general hospitals, at times almost
en masse, the mortality rates in those hospitals would have often
attained proportions as formidable as any which have existed
in military hospitals during this century.
A large proportion, nearly all, of the seriously sick bear trans-
portations very well when properly conducted; and so also do a
majority of the wounded. Provisions should accordingly be made
for the treatment of most of the seriously sick, and many of the
wounded, neither in the camp nor on the battle-field, but at points
more or less remote, yet easy of access from the army by direct
lines of communication. Such transportation as is necessary to
'convey the soldier to these points is a transportation of expediency,
it is the best service which can be rendered to the disabled
soldier himself, and at the same time it is a service to the army.
Still these general evacuations of the sick have their disadvan-
tages ; they involve a heavy loss of time, a large outlay of money
and material, and often result in encumbering the approaches to
an army, to a degree which may prove disastrous. Moreover,
"nothing," says Dr. Letterman, "so disheartens troops and
causes home sickness among those who are well, as sending the
sick to the hospitals outside the army to which they belong;
such was the experience of the armies in the Crimea, and it is
that of all armies." 1 Whatever the good results finally secured,
by sending the sick from an army, the immediate moral effect of
such evacuations upon the army itself is unquestionably bad.
A large number of soldiers must always be treated within the

<pb>
army to which they belong; and I will mention first, those who are
not seriously ill, but need care, attention, and nursing, to prevent
their becoming so. The number of this class is always large, as it
is almost certain to include for a time nearly all the seriously sick.
To make no special provision in the field for the proper treat-
ment of this class, would result in the transference to remote
hospitals of large numbers of soldiers, who would have been
saved to the army by a few days' treatment near by, and whose
transportation in any event might have been needless, had suit-
able provisional regimental and corps hospitals been provided.
But there are special classes of sick and wounded; there are
those who have been stricken with sharp attacks of acute and
painful diseases, and those who have been severely wounded—
by missiles or thrusts, which have penetrated the cavities
of the head, chest, and abdomen—wounding and compromising
the integrity of organs essential to life—by the fracture of
the joints and great bones of the limbs—including nearly
all those cases of wounds, in which so-called capital opera-
tions are required, or are dispensed with only in the hope
that conservative surgery may record a new triumph. These
classes—those sick with short and violent diseases, and those
severely wounded—and the number of the latter is large
after every great battle—are not transportable, in the sense of
being able to sustain an evacuation on to a distant hospital. As
a rule the least transportation is an injury to them, and they
should be conveyed as quickly and as gently as possible to the
nearest hospital, and that hospital should be in the camp or on
or near the field of battle. To attempt to send such people in
horse litters and ambulance waggons over miles of road, to be
transferred to railway carriages, to be re-transferred from car-
riage to carriage, during perhaps two or three days, is a barbar-
ism—is little less than a homicide. I know of no circumstance
which can serve as a pretext even for such a procedure, except it
be the retreat and defeat of an army, and even then it would be
a hundred times better, except perhaps in a war with savages, to
leave the unfortunate suflkrers to the mercy of the enemy, than
to thus torture them and destroy pretty nearly every chance of
life by a cruel kindness.
<pb>
During the late war the Germans made in some respects a
greater use of railway transportation than did the Americans
during the War of the Rebellion. Throughout the whole war
incessant streams of sick and wounded, coming from every army
operating in France, were pouring into the interior of Germany.
Had these sick and wounded belonged exclusively to the classes
able to bear transportation and evacuation, the course pursued
might have been praiseworthy; but so far from this having been
the case, the number of untransportable soldiers who were
hurried off by rail, to be tortured on the way, and finally to die
in distant hospitals, was immense. I know there are persons
who admire this German wholesale system of evacuating battle-
fields and hospitals. I must confess I do not. It is useless to
commend to me the excellence of plaster-of-paris and straw
splints, as instruments for holding in their places the fragments
of a shattered femur, and it would be equally useless to tell me
how comfortably a man with a bullet in his lungs can be borne
in a suspended litter in a railway-carriage. The torture incident
to these transportations is alone a sufficient cause for condemn-
ing them altogether; but the accidents of every kind to which
they give rise, and the diminished chances of recovery which
they entail, involve those who direct them, governments as well
as surgeons, in the gravest responsibilities.
Where these hurried evacuations are resorted to, conservative
surgery has but a poor chance; by the joltings in vehicles, and
the disturbance incident to removals from beds to stretchers and
from stretchers to beds, the positions of the fragments of the
shattered bone are changed—these are detached from their con-
nections, and thrust into the surrounding flesh; inflammation
results, the periosteum is destroyed, the bone dies, and immense
suppurations follow, with burrowing abscesses; the patient begins
to sink; the limb is amputated, and shortly after the patient
dies—and the conclusion is, that it would have been better to
have amputated the limb at first, and that the attempt to save it
was a mistake. No! the mistake—a mistake in such a case
nothing less than a crime—was the sending of the wounded man
to a distant hospital; he should have been treated in a pro-
visional hospital on the field.
<pb>
Says Dr. John A. Lidell, in an able paper on the "Traumatic
Lesions of Bone:"—"Again, clinical observation and reflection
have convinced me that the transportation of our wounded during
the late war exerted an important influence in the production of osteo-
myelitis.1 My attention was first directed to this subject about
the middle of June, 1863, when a considerable number of patients
who had sustained gunshot fractures of the lower extremities
were brought to the Stanton United States Army General Hos-
pital, from the Depot Field Hospital of the army of the Potomac
at Potomac Creek, where they had been under treatment since
the battle of Chancellorsville—a period of about six weeks, and
progressing favourably up to the time of their removal from that
place. Now, all these patients were rendered very much worse
by the transportation; those having fractured thighs suffered
most. Several of these patients died of what I now know was
osteo-myelitis; and there was good reason for believing that
most of these fatal cases would have recovered if the exigencies
of the military service had not rendered the evacuation of
Potomac Creek a matter of necessity. . . . My attention was
again called to the same subject in the summer of 1864. It was
observed in some of the Army General Hospitals at Washington,
and, I believe, in all of them, that osteo-myelitis and kindred
disorders were met with much more frequently among the
wounded brought directly from the army of the Potomac in
the campaign of 1864, which extended from the Rapidan to the
James River, than in the campaign of 1862 and 1863 upon
the Rapidan and the Rappahannock." At first Dr. Lidell
thought the difference might have arisen from other causes, but,
after a careful inquiry into the antecedent history of the cases,
the comparatively long transportation in ambulances and army
waggons over rough roads, to which great numbers of those
wounded in the battles between the Wilderness and Cold Har-
bour inclusive, in 1864, had been subjected, "stood out in bold
relief; and I am thoroughly satisfied," says he, "that this affords
the true explanation of the prevalence of osteo-myelitis among
the wounded brought from those battles. . . . And I am
1 The italics are reproduced from Dr. Lidell's paper.
<pb>
strengthened in that opinion by the statement of Dr. Moses, that
osteo-myelitis was more frequently seen in the Confederate hos-
pital at Charlottesville, among the wounded in the Maryland and
Pennsylvania campaigns, than among those wounded at nearer
and more accessible places; and also by the statement of Surgeon
Henry Janes, U. S. Vols., that but comparatively few cases of
this disease occurred among the wounded at Gettysburg, who
were treated near the field of conflict."1
But I will not dwell longer on this subject; enough has been
said to point out the disastrous consequences which may follow
an indiscriminate transportation of the wounded. The only
remedy is to be found in the establishment of field hospitals or
ambulances, in sufficient number for the treatment of all the
non-transportable wounded who may fall in battle.
Indeed, I can hardly believe that any one well acquainted
with the radical defects, and with the inevitably disastrous conse-
quences, of the traditional method of hospitalizing armies in the
field, can be unwilling to admit that the necessity for a reform is
most urgent—or in brief, that each army or expeditionary corps
should be furnished with shelter for its sick and wounded,
sufficient to render it independent of such resources as may be
furnished by the country within which it is to operate, or so far
independent as to enable it to organize all its field hospitals—its
ambulances—in such a manner as that the evils of exposure, bad
ventilation, and a pernicious and unnecessary transportation may
be avoided; nor do I believe that any one can contend that such
provisional shelter should not realize in the largest degree
possible all those special hygienic conditions now considered
as essential in the establishment of hospitals for the civil
population.
If the American ambulance was established at Paris, it was
for the purpose of showing by a practical example how these
objects might be accomplished.

S I wish to direct your attention particularly to
the material means employed at the American
ambulance, for the purpose of accomplishing the
object had in view — the establishment of a
hospital under canvas, which might equal in
sanitary excellence the best permanent hospital,—in taking up, in
the order of their importance, the several subjects which I pro-
pose to discuss, I am naturally led to speak first of tents. As what
signally characterized the American ambulance was the use there
made of tents and tent-barracks, and as the employment of such
shelter, for many purposes at least, has been known since a very
remote time, it has seemed to me preferable to present in a general
way the history and characteristics of these constructions; and
I am also encouraged to do this, from the fact that very little
exact information is to be found in any work, with which I am
acquainted, as regards either the tents now in use or those
formerly employed.1 But while it has seemed to be highly
desirable that a Report upon a special tent-service, should
contain at least a fair summary of our present knowledge of

The subject holds even a smaller place in French literature, represented as it is by
a single brief " Dissertation sur les Tentes ou Pavilions de Guerre," par M. Beneton

dictionaries, the two works cited complete the bibliography of tents, so far as I am
acquainted with it.

tent architecture, such a dissertation would have appeared
disproportionately voluminous, had it found a place under
any title, in an account of the material organization special to
the American ambulance itself; I have therefore preferred to
introduce it as a separate part, preliminary to a detailed account
of the principal material characteristics of the ambulance.
I shall, in this part of my Report, present the conclusions to
which I have arrived concerning the forms or models of tents
best adapted for the construction of temporary hospitals; I
shall also consider the advantages to be derived from the use
of tent-barracks in the hospitalization of troops, and finally shall
describe at length several of the forms recently proposed for
such constructions.
 
 
]F the word tent is used to signify a portable shelter, the
use of tents is probably nearly coeval with the origin
of man. In Genesis iv. 20, we are told that Jabal was
the father of such as dwell in tents.1 Noah, Lot and Abraham
are said to have been dwellers in tents. Indeed, from early Bible
history we may infer that for many centuries nearly all the inha-
bitants of Palestine and Syria dwelt in tents.2 As in the earliest
ages, so among the primitive and uncivilized tribes which now
inhabit the earth, provisional or temporary shelter is chiefly made
use of; but in the earliest ages, as among the savage races of to-day,
a tent was an establishment, often very different from that which
the word now generally suggests to us. Derived from the Latin
verb tendo, a tentorium; tent, conveys to our minds the idea of a
1 According to the Biblical account, the use of permanent houses preceded that of
tents (see Gen. iv. 17); but it is more than probable, that when the Judaical Genesis
begins to speak of men and their social habits, the human race had already exhibited
itself in a variety of phases, and had shown its power as well to build and dwell in
cities, as to snbsist in ways more primitive.
* "And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two
maidservants' tents, but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's tent into
Rachel's tent."—Genesis xxxi. 33, &c.
<pb>
shelter stretched out, or of one afforded by some material which
is capable of being stretched out at will. It also, almost inva-
riably, suggests to us a construction made of canvas or some
woven stuff. Among all primitive people, however, the "tent"
only represents that provisional and more or less portable shelter
which they may have the habit of constructing to protect them-
selves against the heat of the sun, or the vicissitudes of the
weather. In the East, where time has wrought few changes in
the customs of the people who inhabit those countries whence
come our earliest traditions, the tents of Jabal and of Abraham
may still be seen. The writer of this report has a most un-
pleasant remembrance of a compulsory study of the architec-
ture and merits of one of these constructions among the
Bedouins of the Jordan. The tent—the subject of his painful
inspection—was about ten feet square, and six or seven feet
high, and was formed entirely of sticks and the branches of
trees; with the latter it was thatched overhead, and covered on
three sides—the fourth served most conveniently as a doorway,
being always wide open; on the ground within was a bit of dirty
carpet. It was a rude hut en bivouac, that only served to keep
the sun out by day and the dew by night; and although the hos-
pitality of its proprietor left nothing to be desired, except perhaps
a less avaricious thirst for backsheesh, a day passed within it,
pretty effectually destroyed all the associations of romance, which
he may ever have entertained in connection with tent life, whether
among modern or patriarchal Bedouins.1 The "booth" which
1 I do not wish to convey the impression, that the Bedouins make use of no other
kind of temporary shelter than that which I have described; they often shelter
themselves under constructions covered with coarse hair-cloth or skins. Says old
Sir John Maundeville:—" In that Syrian desert dwell many of the Arabians who are
called Bedouins and Ascopardes, who are people full of all evil conditions, having no
houses but tents, which they make of the skins of camels and other beasts which
they eat, and under these they sleep and dwell in places where they can find water."
Strabo called these Arabs "tent dwellers," irxmrcu (Strabo, book xvi.); and Pliny
gives the same name to them—" scenitse "—because they were in the habit of living
in tents (N. H., book vi.). Still, these names are not incompatible with their having
dwelt, two thousand years ago, in constructions such as I have described, "booths,"
which are now much used by the Bedouins, as they also are, and there is every
reason to believe have been, used by other Syrian tribes, both ancient and modern.
<pb>
the prophet Jonah is said to have made and sat under, on the east
side of Nineveh, was probably a construction of this sort.
The branches and bark of trees, reeds, and grass, have always
been largely used by the constructors of temporary shelter.
Many of the nomadic tribes of Siberia still make their huts or
tents of the bark of trees; among these, may be mentioned the
Kalmucks, the Tungoosians and the Buraets, who employ birch
bark for this special purpose. This bark being very flexible, is
sewed together piece by piece, and is often very handsomely
embroidered.1 Many of our American Indians were also in the
habit of using bark as a covering for their "wigwams;" they
also occasionally used reeds and grass for this purpose, as do
the Hottentots of this day, who, weaving these materials into
mats, make of them a shelter, somewhat as Caesar informs us
the soldiers of his legions, whom he had embarked into Africa,
constructed for themselves tents arundinihus scopisque contextis?
Achilles' tent, if more imposing, was only a slight improvement
upon the same style of architecture.8
Herodotus mentions a peculiar people living on the confines
of Scythia, "who dwell all the year round under trees. During
the winter they cover these trees with a sort of felt, made of
white wool; this covering is taken off as the season becomes
warm."* During the Peninsular campaign (1811-14), the Eng.
lish troops, when unprovided with canvas tents, were in the
habit of constructing for themselves a kind of shelter, which is
thus described by Luscombe:—" The plan pursued was to select

s "De Bello Africano," c. xlvii. Caesar also here says, that his soldiers made for
themselves little tents out of their clothing—" ex vestimentis tentoriolis factis;"
and more than all, that these makeshifts were quite useless,—that the rain beat
through them, that the fires were put out and the provisions spoiled, and the soldiers
at length forced to protect themselves, as best they could, under their shields.

And now approach'd Pelides' lofty tent;

a tree (generally a cork tree or an evergreen oak) which had
wide-spreading branches; a lower branch was then nearly cut
through, so as to allow the extreme points to drop to the
ground; other branches were then cut from adjoining trees, and
fixed in the ground, so as to form nearly a circle of sufficient
dimensions, placed nearly upright, and with the upper branches
resting on that branch of the tree under which the hut was to be
constructed, and which had been dropped towards the ground.
Smaller branches were then interwoven to thicken the walls of
the hut, which was afterwards lined on the inside with the
broom plant, in the manner of thatching. Care being taken that
the door of the hut should have an aspect of nearly due east (so
that the sun might pass over it before reaching the horizon), a
very agreeable residence was thus provided during the day." 1
It is described, however, as cold at night, and as probably pre-
judicial to health.
The first real improvement in the construction of temporary
shelter, dates from the time when skins began to take the place
of the branches and the bark of trees, reeds, and grass. Con-
structions made of the latter materials are scarcely portable; and
although "leafy bowers" may furnish a shelter better than none,
it is not to be compared with that obtained by the use
of skins, of which material probably was made the first con-
struction that could with accuracy be called a tent. The first
instance on record in which skins were used to furnish a shelter,
is in Exodus xxvii. 14:—"And thou shalt make a covering
for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering above of
badgers' skins." The tent here alluded to was none other than the
Tabernacle.3 Indeed, the Israelites, immediately they escaped

* From the Bible description of the Tabernacle, as also from the description given
by Josephus (book iii. c. 5, "History of the Jews"), it is quite evident that this
construction was a tent-barrack, covered almost entirely with tissues of "fino
twined linen," and with "hangings of blue, and purple, and scarlet," and only
provided with double roofs of coarse goats' hair cloth and skins, to secure its more
complete protection from the destructive action of the weather—from rain and
sunlight.
<pb>
from their Egyptian servitude (b. c. 1531), reverted to their
ancestral habits of living, and adopted the general customs of
the neighbouring nomadic races. "The children of Israel jour-
neyed from Rameses to Succoth." 1 The meaning of the word Suc-
coth is The Tents.2 Their tents were probably made of skins,
as also of coarse tissues of goats' hair, camels' hair, wool, and
linen. Whether skins or woven fabrics were most commonly
employed by them for tent coverings, it is difficult to say,
although probably, as is now the case in the East, coarse fabrics
were generally employed in the construction of their temporary
shelter.
The tents now most common among the Arab sheiks are
made of camels' hair or goats' hair cloth, and are of a dark grey
colour ; they are sometimes even quite black.3 They are oblong
in form, from twenty to forty feet in length, from ten to twenty
feet in depth, from eight to twelve feet in height, and are sup-
ported by numerous poles within, and pickets and cords without.
The walls are tied on to the roof, which generally slopes one way—
back from the front, which is almost constantly open.* The tent
is usually divided into apartments by means of curtains. The
inside lining of the tent is generally of some bright-coloured
cloth, and the floor is often richly carpeted. These tents have
frequently been said to resemble the hulls of ships upside down;
but the similitude was probably first suggested rather by a re-
membrance of Sallust's description of the Numidian "mapalia"—
1 Exodus xii. 37.
4 "Et Jacob venit in Socoth; ubi redificata domo et fixis tentoriis, appellavit
nomen loci illius Socoth, id est tabernacula."—Gen. xxxiii. 17, " Biblia Sacra Vul-
gate editionis Sexti V. et Clem. VIII." In the English version, " booths " is used
as the equivalent of Succoth, as well as for the word rendered in the Vulgate by
tentoriis.
3 "Solomon's Song," i. 5. Volney, vol. i. p. 279. The tents of Kedar are said to
have been made of goats' hair mixed with camels' hair. The Arabs still call their
tents beet el shaar—" houses of hair," and the colour of the covering was determined
by the natural colour of the hair used in weaving it. It has been said, (D'Arvieux,
"Voyage dans la Palestine ") that hair-cloth was chosen for the purpose of excluding
the rain and dew; if hair-cloth was used instead of other cloths, it was for the
simple reason that among the nomads of Arabia, goats' hair and camels' hair were
the principal textile materials known.
4 "And Abraham sat in the tent door in the heat of the day."—Genesis xviii. 1.
<pb>
"quasi navium carinae sunt" 1—than by the appearance of the
tents. The Arab tent can at any time be easily increased in
size by stretching out the main coverings, and attaching, if
necessary, curtains, at the same time replanting the pins and
lengthening the cords. It is in allusion to this very ancient
practice that the prophet Isaiah exclaims:—" Enlarge the place
of thy tent; and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine
habitations; spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy
stakes."a These tents, however, vary very much in size, quality,
and elegance; conditions usually dependent upon the wealth of
their owners; but the more imposing examples of Arab tent
architecture are so far suggestive of the construction described
in Exodus, as to render it highly probable, that they represent
similar phases of life in the history of civilization. Not only
were tents used by the nomadic tribes dwelling in Syria during
the earlier periods of Jewish history, but there is reason to be-
lieve that they were subsequently, to some extent, used even
within the walls of cities, or, as has been suggested, it is not un-
likely that the dwellers in cities, at certain seasons of the year,
were in the habit of resorting to tents. This at least was a
Jewish custom,8 and one which, from the general life of the sur-
rounding population, could hardly have been peculiar. The
Egyptians are said not only to have used tents in war, but to
have pitched them upon their house tops. So representations
of tents are to be seen on some of the sculptures found at
Nineveh, together with articles of tent furniture, many of
which are quite similar to those still thought most essential
to common life in the East.4
Harmer informs us that Tamasp, a Persian monarch, passed
his winters at Cashbin, and his summers in tents, at the foot of
1 "Bell. Jugurth." c. xviii. 8 Isaiah liv. 2.
3 Leviticus xxiii. 42. It may be observed, however, that the "feast of taber-
nacles" was not peculiar to the-Jews. The Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans had
also their skenopegia. These feasts were held in the spring or early summer: by
the Egyptians, in honour of the god Thammus (Osiris); by the Greeks, in honour
of Bacchus; and by the Romans, as a thank-offering to Nature, under the name of
Anna Perenna.

Mount Alouvent, a place celebrated for its coolness and its
delightful scenery; and he states that the custom of this monarch
was maintained in Persia until the time of Abbas the Great,
who established his court permanently at Ispahan.1 Paxton
supposes that "the curtains of Solomon" were tents to which
that great king retired in the heats of summer,2 and Pococke
and other travellers3 have mentioned the summer villages of can-
vas, or of reeds and boughs, still to be met with in the East, oc-
cupied by people whose winter houses stand empty for the time
in the neighbourhood.
Long after a certain civilization had been attained, many of
the races of Central Asia cared very little for permanent shelter,
as may be inferred, from the statements of several ancient writers
who have spoken of tents mounted upon wheels, to be drawn by
horses or cattle, as among the peculiar institutions of some of
the more wealthy and prosperous of these races.8 Such state-
ments are, however, evidently exaggerations resulting from the
fact that these nomads have occasionally dispensed with all
shelter, except that afforded by carts or waggons covered with
bark, felt, or stuffs of wool or goats' hair.6 A very good idea
of the construction of the dwellings used by vast numbers of

* As tents have long been so indispensable to those living in the East, it is quite
natural that we should occasionally meet with Oriental allusions to their use by
houseless spirits after death. One of the most curious of these allusions occurs in
connection with this story. After the establishment of Mahometanism, on a certain
occasion, a theological dispute arose between some doctors of that religion and some
Jewish rabbis. These last, it is said, positively denying that the others would ever
find a place in Paradise, the Mahometans replied,—"Since you pretend that we
shall never enter there, and as it seems to be your wish that we remain outside of
the gate, it will be necessary for you to provide us with the means of obtaining
tents" (jpapiliones). And on this pretext the Jews were immediately charged with a
tax, which the Turks have continued to levy, in the language of the narrator, " even
to this day."
5 Strabo, book iv. c. 2, 7. Herodotus also mentions these tents on wheels; and
Horace has given them notoriety, by referring to the Scythians:—
"Quorum plaustra vagas rite trahunt domos."—Od. iii. 24, 10.
6 "Cum carpentis, in quibus habitant."—Ammianus Marcettinus, lib. xxxi. c. 2.
<pb>
Asiatics, whether in ancient or modern times, may be
derived from Atkinson's description of a Kirgis yourt. "The
yourt was formed of willow trellis-work, put together with un-
tanned strips of skin, made into compartments which fold up.
It was a circle of thirty-four feet in diameter, five feet high to
the springing of the dome, and twelve feet in the centre. This
dome is formed of bent rods of willow, one and a quarter inches
in diameter, put into the mortise-holes of a ring about four feet
across, which secures the top of the dome, admits light, and lets
out the smoke. The lower ends of the willow rods are tied with
leathern thongs to the top of the trellis-work at the sides, which
renders it quite strong and secure. The whole is then covered
with large sheets of voilock, made of wool and camels' hair,
fitting close, making it water-tight and warm. A small aperture
in the trellis-work forms a doorway, over which a piece of
voilock hangs down and closes it; but in the day time this is
rolled up and secured on the top of the yourt. Such is the
dwelling of a great and wealthy chief in the steppe." 1
In general, it may be stated that tents of various kinds have
been extensively employed as domiciles, by a considerable portion
of the whole population of Western and Central Asia, since a
time almost immemorial.
Nor has the habit of dwelling in tents or temporary domiciles
been limited to that quarter of the globe. A large part of the
human family has been reared in tents, and is still acquainted
with no other kind of shelter. In construction, these temporary
habitations have varied with the climate and products of the
country, and with the necessities and special tastes of the races
using them. An almost endless variety may be found described
in books of travel. But whatever interest may be connected with
many of these descriptions, my present object is rather to con-
sider the use which has been made of tents in war.

| HE Greeks are said to have encamped in tents at the
siege of Troy; and they were at that time undoubtedly
acquainted with the use of tents of skins or woven
fabrics. The large fleets, which seem to have been constantly
lying before the Greek camps during that memorable siege,
sufficiently show, that there was no lack of those materials from
which tents as well as sails are made. But, curiously enough,
although Homer alludes frequently to the camp quarters of the
Greeks, he never mentions the use of tents of canvas, or skins.
The word jcXio-t'q, which he almost uniformly employs,1 when
speaking of the lodgings of the chiefs, as well as of the common
soldiers, signifies a hut or a cabin, rather than a tent. Thus, as
we have already seen, the tent of Achilles was a sturdy frame-
work, thatched with grass; and Homer speaks of it even, as if it
were divided into separate apartments.2 Indeed, early Greek
writers have perhaps spoken less frequently of portable shelter
than would have been the case, had the employment of such
shelter been considered by them, at any time, as indispensable
to an army.
Herodotus does not allude to the existence of tents in the
Greek armies, and refers but twice to their use in war by the
Persians; from one of these references, however, we may infer
that they were not only numerous, at the time of his writing, in
Persian camps, but that they were not wanting in any of the
adjuncts and appurtenances of barbaric splendour. After the
battle of Platse, Pausanias forbade, in a proclamation, any soldier
to touch the plunder which had been captured from the Persians,
and at the same time, ordered the Helots to bring it all together
into one place:—" And they went through the camp finding tents,
1 "Iliad," book i. 11. 189, 325, 346, 391, 485; book ix. 11. 71, 107, 178,185,
226, 263, 622, 652, 663, 669, and in many other places.

<pb>
resplendent with gold and silver;1 beds, covered with gold and
silver ornaments, vases, goblets, and other drinking vessels of
gold; and in sacks, loaded upon waggons, gold and silver
kettles."* The magnificence of the Persian camp equipage at
this period is confirmed by the statements of other writers. Thus
Plutarch says, that Aristides did not disappoint those who held
him in estimation, on being left at Marathon to guard the prison-
ers and the booty captured from the Persians:—" For although
gold and silver were scattered here and there in the tents (iv
rate ffwjvaic), and the ships that had been taken were full of
magnificent articles of clothing and countless riches, he not
only did not appropriate any of these things to himself, but
kept others from so doing."3 Xenophon mentions the capture
of the tent (rj aKnvy) of Teribasus, in which were found beds
with silver feet, and drinking cups, as also servants, who
reported themselves to be his bakers and cup-bearers.4 Xeno-
phon also speaks several times, in his account of the expedition
1 0-Knviif Ka.Tccxcuajijyt.itai xyuau xa\ apyupa. The Greek word <rxw»j, which is
generally considered as synonymous with tentorium, tent, tente, &c., is derived
from the verb crxeu, to cover—from which crxia, a shade—and signifies a tem-
porary domicile, "made," says Stephanus, "of the branches of trees, straw,
boards, skins, linen or woollen cloth, or similar material, commonly erected in
camps and gardens to make a shade, or as a protection against the rain." The
word a-xwn cannot, therefore, be regarded as the equivalent of the English word
tent; as for example, in the passage, crxwa) \euxoS xmou xou aiwrixav, tents of
white ivy and vines—arbours—which has caused Stephanus to observe: "Nec
enim hie reddere queas tabernaculum, quod ex tabulis potius construitur; nec
tentorium quod ex pannis lineis laneisve aut pellibus tensis, sed umbracula." (Ste-
phanus, "Thesaurus Qrecee Linguae;" see also Casaubon, "Animadversio in Athe-
naeum," 1. iv. c. 21.) So the word ex-warn—tentorium pono, I pitch a tent—the
several inflected forms of which are frequently found in Greek authors, indicates the
establishment of a camp under no specific kind of shelter, and oftentimes simply
relates to the halting of the army for the night. Still the words crxnn, axho^
and their derivatives, were used by Greek writers to indicate those specific con-
structions called in English, tents.

had their tents.

of Cyrus, of the Greek "soldier's tent;" and he moreover says
they were made of skins. Coming to the Euphrates, the soldiers
crossed over it in the following manner:—" They filled the skins,
which they made use of for tents, with dried hay, then joined and
sewed them together so close, that the water could not get at the
hay; upon these they passed the river."1 Arrian also informs us
that Alexander crossed the Oxus, by making use in a similar
way of the skins of the soldiers' tents.2
That the Greek soldiers who set out upon the expedition of
Cyrus, were well supplied with tents, may be inferred from a
circumstance which took place after the death of Cyrus, and
when, Xenophon having been chosen to command the Greeks, it
was resolved to return to Greece. In a speech made to his
soldiers, Xenophon said:—" In the first place I think we ought to
burn all the carriages, that the care of them may not influence
our march, but that we may be directed in it by the advantage
of the army. After that, we ought to burn our tents3 also, for
they are troublesome to carry, and of no use either in fighting
or supplying ourselves with provisions. . . . And after he
had said this, they all rose up, and departing, burnt their
carriages and tents."4
With regard to the size of the Greek tents, and their forms
and qualities, we are quite ignorant, as we also are of the
whole art of castrametation, as practised by the ancient
Greeks and Macedonians. To what extent the use of tents
among the Greeks may have been adopted from the Persians, it
is difficult to determine; it is very certain, however, that the use
of splendid tents came as one of the results of the Asiatic

conquest of the Greeks. We first hear of them in the Greek
cities of Asia Minor, and Plutarch particularly notices the mag-
nificent tent, which the Ephesians erected in honour of Alci-
biades.1 I have already alluded to the wealth found in the
captured camps of Xerxes' armies. His successor, Darius, was
not less prodigal in the equipment of his troops, and his own
royal pavilion is spoken of as a wonder, full of everything
which luxury could suggest or wealth obtain, while above the
pavilion, where all could see it, "flamed an image of the sun set
in crystal."* Alexander seems at times, if we can credit the
accounts which have reached us, to have even surpassed Darius
in the magnificence of his pavilions. At least, the splendours of
Alexander's tent, "tabernaculo adornato quod centum lectos
caperet,"3 held their place, even among the legends of popular
mediaeval romance.4
In the second book of the "Deipnosophistae" of Athenaeus, is
an account taken from Masurius or Callixenus Rhodius, of the
splendid fetes given by Ptolemy Philadelphus, in celebration
of the apotheosis of the first Ptolemy (Soter). A tent (aKtivfjv) of
marvellous beauty was erected within the citadel of Alexandria;
it was fifty cubits high, and supported by wooden columns, some
of them so carved as to represent the foliage of palm-trees, while
others imitated the thyrsus. The ceiling of the tent was of
purple cloth, embroidered with white, while all around hung
draperies festooning the supports, the spaces between which were
filled with various emblematical pictures. The ground was
covered with Persian carpets, inwoven with the figures of

animals. In one of these tents were one hundred golden beds,
with sphinxes' feet, arranged in a circle on the sides, and over-
hung with purple tapestry of velvet.. And here also were
placed two hundred tables, fitted with silver shelves. At the
end of the tent, below the beds, were one hundred silver basins
and ewers, and farther down, upon a superb sideboard, were
vases and goblets and the splendid service of the feast, of won-
derful workmanship, in gems and gold.
Athenaeus estimates at ten thousand silver talents, (over
7,500,000 dollars,) the value of the vases and goblets alone, used
upon these tables; and this without counting either the cost of
the workmanship, or the precious stones which might have been
set in them.1
But I have perhaps dwelt sufficiently upon constructions
which rather illustrate the ancient wealth and prodigality of
the East, than the common life of the armies which have become
famous in its history.
From a passage in Livy, it has been inferred that tents were
adopted in the Roman army during the second year of the siege of
Veii, in the 349th year after the foundation of Rome. These tents
were said to have been made of skins or leather. There are
reasons for believing, however, that tents were used by the Romans
before this time. If we can trust the statement of Dionysius of
Halicarnassus, the cities of Latium, which were engaged in
almost perpetual wars with the Romans, after the expulsion of
the kings, were rich and even highly civilized. Dionysius fre-
quently alludes to the presence of tents in the armies sent by
these cities against Rome.2 In the 300th year of Rome, in the
campaign which Siccius conducted against the ^Eques, Siccius
having captured the enemy's camp, "set fire to the tents, (rag
oKtjvag,) which were full of arms, and corn, and goods, and muni-
tions of war, and burnt up all the plunder and wealth which had
been stripped from the Tusculans."8 In the first year of the 83rd
Olympiad (306th year of Rome), the Romans again declared
war against the iEques, and were in turn defeated. In narrating

this defeat, Dionysius for the first time speaks of Roman tents:—
"The enemy plundered their tents, carried off their beasts of
burden, their silver, their slaves, and all their munitions and
apparatus of war." 1
Moreover, Livy does not say that tents were first used by the
Romans at the siege of Veii; he says, the Roman generals then
first caused winter quarters to be built—hibernacula etiam cedi-
ficari coepta, res nova militi Romano.2 The words hibernacula and
cedificari would hardly have been used had it been proposed to
provide only tents. It is true that the demagogical tribunes
made the continuance of the campaign a pretext for complaining
that the whole army was thus forced to pass the winter in tents
—subpellibus durare;3 but this expression, even, implies that the
army had long been more or less accustomed to be sub pellibus
in summer encampments; and the inference is confirmed by the
statement of Florus, that at this siege of Veii, the Roman army
first passed the winter under tents made of skin—tunc primum
hiematum sub pellibus.*
Of the form and qualities of the tents used in encampments, in
the earlier periods of Roman history, as also of the proportion of
the tents to the troops in the field, we know almost nothing. There
were times when their use is said to have been forbidden
even in the winter,8 and the Roman military authorities seem
always to have considered tents as an impediment, and to have
not unfrequently dispensed with them altogether. Probably
Ovid's fines very accurately represent Roman encampments, as
they existed for a long time after tents first began to be used:—
"Sub Jove pars durat; pauci tentoria ponunt;
Sunt quibus e ramis frondea facta casa est." 6
Camped a few in tents, some in the open air,
While bowers and booths were well-nigh everywhere.
It is evident, however, that as the Roman armies became

larger and better organized, and were sent upon more distant
and longer campaigns, the necessity of sheltering the troops be-
coming more and more apparent, tents began to be regarded as
an indispensable part of a soldier's equipment.
Livy, in his "History of Rome," speaks of tents or huts—
tentoria, tabernacula—perhaps twenty times; but the words, unfor-
tunately, generally occur quite unaccompanied by any account,
either direct or indirect, of their forms, construction, or qualities.1
After the defeat of the Romans by the Etruscans (300 b. c), Vale-
rius Maximus is said to have found, on visiting the Roman camp,
the cohorts which had lost their standards, outside of the stockade
and destitute of tents.4 The obvious inference from this state-
ment is, that the cohorts at the time mentioned were habitually
provided with tents; and we are told that when Pyrrhus, about
twenty years later, during the war of Tarentum, having taken a
considerable number of Roman prisoners, gave these up without
ransom, the Roman general, wishing to punish these troops for
having been taken prisoners, degraded them all, and among
other punishments, refused to the foot soldiers the use of
their tents.8
Livy also informs us, that less than a hundred years after, the
regularity and order observed in laving out a Roman camp were
1 I may here remark that the word tabernaculum, although sometimes used by
Latin writers as a synonym of tentorium, generally signifies a hut or booth, and not
a tent. Thus Caesar, in speaking of the luxury in Pompey's camp, says, there were
tables and sideboards loaded with silver plate, "and booths covered with fresh turf,
and some even, as that of L. Lentulus, overhung with ivy "—recentibus cespitibus
tabernacula constrata, L. etiam Lentuli et nonnullorum tabernacida proUcta ederd.
(" De Bello Civili," lib. iii. c. 96.) Although the word tabernacula in this connec-
tion has frequently been translated by the words tents, tentes, such translations are
inexact. The improbability of laying courses of sods, or training vines upon awnings
of skin or canvas, is quite evident. Lucan, in speaking of the same booths, says:
"Capit impia plobcs
Cespite patricio somnos."

such, as to particularly excite the admiration of those who were
then first made acquainted with the Roman system of castrameta-
tion. Thus Philip of Macedonia, when he first saw a Roman camp,
and observed the regularity with which the tents were pitched,
and the width of the streets, said:—" Such a camp cannot be the
camp of barbarians." 1 In the war which followed against Perseus,
each soldier had his tent ;a and Scipio Asiaticus, when carrying
on war against Antiochus, informed his soldiers, that unless the
campaign was brought to a speedy close, they would be compelled
to winter in their tents—aut sub pellibus habendos milites fore}
It is certainly a little surprising that Polybius, who, in a work
written about 150 years before the Christian era, devotes a
chapter to the description of the Roman system of castrameta-
tion, should enter into no details relating either to the form of
the tents used, or the materials of which they were made. His
description, however, of the position of the tents occupied by the
generals, the tribunes, and the troops of each class, makes it per-
fectly certain that portable tents had been regarded as essential
to well organized camps long before his time.
Caesar gives us to understand, that his troops were generally
well provided with shelter in tabernaculis* as also, that even the
sutlers who followed his armies had their tents, on the borders
of the camp—sub vallo tenderent mercatores.5
Caesar also tells us, that the tents were sometimes used as a
roofing to other constructions. Thus, on one occasion, his men
were quartered partly in houses and partly in constructions
covered over with skins and thatch—atque in tectapartim Gallorum,
partim quo?, conjectis celeriter stramentis tentoriorum integendorum
gratid, erant incedificata, milites contegit."

* "De Bello Gallico," lib. i. c. 39. * Ibid. lib. vi. c 37.
6 Ibid, lib.viii. c. 5. May we not infer, from a passage in Caesar, that tents were
sometimes similarly used to protect the soldiers on transport ships? The troops on
a certain expedition, are said to have been so short of water, as to have been com-
pelled to gather the dew which fell during the night upon the skins which covered
the ships—ex pellibus, quibus erant Uctce nave3. (" De Bello Civili," lib. iii. c. 15.)
<pb>
And finally, at a later period, we find Vegetius laying down the
rule, that, if the health of the army is to be considered, not even
in the summer should the soldier be without a tent—ne sine ten-
toriis cestate milites commorentur} Indeed, mere allusions to the
presence of tents in Roman armies, may be found as frequently
in contemporaneous writers, as allusions to a similar means of
encampment, are to be found in the literature of our own time,
for they are by no means confined to the purely historical writers.
Thus Lucan speaks particularly of Caesar's tents,—
"Deseruere cavo tentoria fixa Leraanno,
Castraque quse Vogesi curvam super ardua rupem." s
And again,—
"Et subitus rapti munimine cespitis agger
Prsebet securos intra tentoria somnos." s
But to multiply these citations is needless; what is principally
to be regretted is, that with all the abundant and even inex-
haustible evidence of the almost constant presence of tents in
Roman encampments, at this time (that of Caesar), scarcely a
word is to be found descriptive of them, while even the bas-
reliefs and medals, in which their outward forms may have been
repeated, have probably disappeared for ever.
Reticent as have been Roman historians on nearly every sub-
ject, which directly concerned the administration of their own
military service, we can hardly expect from them much in-
formation concerning the measures adopted by foreign states
for maintaining and supplying active armies.
Caesar gives no account of the manner in which the Gauls,
Germans, or Britons, were in the habit of sheltering themselves
during their campaigns; except, perhaps, when speaking of a
certain Roman camp, he says the cabins of the troops were
covered with straw, in the Gallic fashion? In but a single
instance, however, does he refer to a Gallic tabernaculum, that of
Teutomatus ;4 and as for the Germans, he only says, in speaking

t
of the Suevi, that they were a nomadic people, who never remained
longer than a year in one place.1 There can be little doubt, how-
ever, that both the Germans and the Gauls, accustomed as they were
to the use of various kinds of temporary shelter, were acquainted
with that furnished by light and portable coverings. It is scarcely
necessary to refer to the well-known readiness of the Gauls, in par-
ticular, to imitate their enemies in the use of everything which
promised to be of the least service in war;s the immense amount
of baggage which constantly followed their armies, and the
frequent presence in their camps of the women and children of
the whole tribe which might be at war, are the indirect but
sufficient proofs that such coverings were used by them.3 Plu-
tarch, moreover, distinctly asserts that the Gauls used tents,
during their wars with Caesar; and that their tents were true
tents of skin, or some kind of cloth, is evident from the fact,
that at least on one occasion, they formed no inconsiderable part
of the plunder brought into the Roman camp.4
Two or three passages in Livy have fortunately preserved for us
the fact that the expeditionary armies of Carthage were provided
with portable tents. We are told that when Hannibal crossed the
Alps into Italy, the weather was severely cold, and that his troops
were in the habit of building up fires before their tents—ignibus
1 Caesar, " Bello Gallico," lib. iv. c. 1. Tacitus says, everybody knows the Ger-
mans do not live in cities; that the art of building seemed to be unknown among
them; that thoy constructed their huts of the rudest materials; and that they very
commonly passed the winter in holes dug in the ground—Solent et subterraneos
specus aperire,—suffug'mm Jiiemi et receptaeulum frugibus (" Germania," c. 16);
and this practice seems to havo long prevailed, among the rude races who inhabited
northern Europe. So late as the tenth century, a large portion of the Scandinavian
peasantry passed the winter in trenches in the ground; while their chiefs lived in
huts built of timber, but so covered over with earth and turf as to resemble natural
hillocks, especially when crowned with the rank vegetation, which sprung up upon
them, during the spring and summer months. (" Les Scandenaves." Paris, 1801;

ante tentoria factis.1 But this statement is followed by another
even more explicit; it substantially proves that the tentoria above
mentioned were carried on the march, and that they were more-
over made of skins or some kind of cloth. Shortly after Hannibal
had broken up his winter camp, his troops, while crossing the
Apennines, were overtaken by a great storm followed by cold
and windy weather, which occasioned sufferings, if possible,
severer even than those which had been endured in crossing the
Alps; and the principal or direct cause of these sufferings, is said
to have arisen from the circumstance that the tents, soaked by
the rain, became so stiff when it grew cold as to make it nearly
or quite impossible to unroll them, while a violent wind blew
down everything which was set up.s Hannibal also is said to
have occasionally deceived the Romans by leaving some of his
tents standing on moving out of his camps.3
Again, Asdrubal's army in Spain is represented as encamped
in tents, in which the soldiers quietly reposed—quietos in tentoriis
suis.*
But the most remarkable account which Livy gives of a Car-
thaginian encampment, relates to certain winter quarters occu-
pied by Asdrubal, after Scipio had carried the war into Africa.
These winter quarters were made for the most part of light and
unsubstantial wood, the materials having been brought in very
hurriedly from the surrounding country; those of the Numidians,
especially, were made almost entirely of reeds and coarse matting,
and were scattered about without order.5 The camp being thus
composed of frail cabins, Scipio burned it up—froximis casis
injectus ignis h&sit? A similar encampment is said to have
been formed by Nabis, King of Lacedemonia, during his war

with the Romans (192 B.C.)1 As this camp was likewise de-
stroyed by fire, we may we.ll doubt if constructions of the sort
described, were much resorted to by the Romans after, engaging
upon wars of conquest, they had established their armies upon
a permanent footing. It is true that Tacitus speaks of Corbulo's
army wintering in Cappadocia raptim erectis tuguriis ;2 but the
Romans unquestionably preferred, as well for strategic reasons
as from considerations of convenience, small solidly constructed
huts, tabernacula, for their stationary or winter camps; and for
their flying or summer camps, tentoria, tents made of skins.
Bardin says that "when campaigns were inevitably prolonged,
the huts and barracks, which were called tabernacula, were
replaced by tents made of skins." 3 This would seem to be an
inversion of modern practice in the method of sheltering troops.
It will be understood, however, that as these huts, or booths,
were constructed of boards, the branches of trees, or even turf,
they were seldom transportable, and that in consequence, tents
of skin were greatly to be preferred for active campaigning.
The Romans rarely earned on war in the winter, but were ac-
customed to take up their quarters, as soon as the season became
inclement, in Mbernis. The character of the constructions within
which the troops dwelt, in these winter quarters, is very rarely indi-
cated in Latin authors. It is occasionally evident, however, from
the context, that the troops were then often quartered upon the
inhabitants of the towns and cities at or near the seat of the war.4
Probably, in most cases, the army passed the winter in huts, taber-
nacula, while occasionally, as we have seen, they continued to re-
main, notwithstanding the inclemency of the season, sub pettibus.
It is very certain that the Romans in their winter camps,
stativa hiberna, generally hutted their troops, and that the use of
tents of skin in the winter, was always considered a hardship.
Thus Tacitus, referring to the strict discipline of Corbulo, says:—
1 "Pauci tabernacula haberent, multitudo alia casas ex arundine textas fronde,
quse umbram modo prseberet, texissent,'' &c.—Livy, book xxxv. c. 27.

"The whole army was kept in tents, sub pellibus, although the
rigour of the winter was such, that the earth, covered with
ice, would not without digging afford a place for the tents."1
And Frontinus, among the numerous examples which he gives
of the exercise of a strict and even severe military discipline,
states that:—" The Senate ordered the consul Valerius to lead
his defeated army to Serinum, and there establish his camp, and
pass the winter under tents."2
The only details we possess, concerning the form and size of
Roman tents, date from the time of Trajan.
On the column erected to commemorate the Dacian campaign
of this Emperor, are representations of the equipage used by the
troops engaged in that expedition. Among these, are the figures
of huts and tents. If the bas-reliefs on this column faithfully
represent the several kinds of shelter used by Roman armies, at
the beginning of the second century, it would seem as if small
framed houses were then more employed as a shelter than tents,
while even of the tents, most appear to have had wooden frames

frequently chose to delineate were not those most common in
Roman camps.
The first figure to which I may call attention (Fig. 6) is
that of a small wooden building, which was very likely intended

to represent a well-constructed tabemaeulum, or soldier's hut.
It will hardly do, however, to infer from the sketch that the
Roman troops were habitually quartered, even in permanent
camps, in such well-built barracks; it is by no means improbable
that these strong wooden buildings were used chiefly for store-
houses; whatever may have been the uses to which they were
put, there is an artistic finish about the relief which was probably
absent in the model.
Fig. 7 represents also a tabemaeulum, but one made on
a different principle. A frame-work of wood, surmounted by a
roof covered with shingles or boards, is enclosed on all sides by
curtains of some flexible material impermeable to rain. These
are so arranged as to be opened, or even rolled up and attached
to the roof, the weather permitting. This tabemaeulum is in
principle a very excellent example of the constructions now
known as tent-barracks.
Vopiscus may have referred to such constructions when, in
his "Life of Aurelian," he speaks of the skins prepared for the
tabernacula and tents—pelles ad tabemacula et tentoria paratce.
Sometimes the frame-work was made lighter, the roof as well

as the walls being covered with skins or canvas, as was probably
the case in a tent represented on the column of Trajan, and of
which a sketch is shown in Fig. 8. To that construction,
Livy's words might be applicable—nautici tabernacula detendunt.1
The characteristic peculiarity of the tabemaeulum seems to

have been its frame-work; it might be covered with boards, or
turf, or skins, or canvas, and have various sizes and shapes, but it
would appear always to have been supported by a skeleton of
posts and rafters, and often, in this respect only to have differed
from the tentorium.
Isidorus says, the tabernacula were so called, because the
coverings stretched out with cords rested upon a frame-work,
which sustained the tent—Dicta tabernacula, quod cortince funibus
distentm tabulis interstantibus, appenderentur, qua tentoria sm-
tinerent.1

ordinary soldier's tent; its primitive form is proof sufficient of
this. Doubtless, the form and size of the common soldiers'
tentorium varied more or less at different periods of Roman
history, and according to special circumstances, but it is almost
certain that the sketch in the figure, representing, as it does,
one of the types of tent construction most common to all
asres and to all countries, also shows one of the forms most used
by the Romans, not only of Trajan's time, but during many
preceding centuries, and conveys to us the best idea it is possible
now to obtain of the character of the shelter Roman troops
were provided with, when they were said to be sub pellibus.
This tentorium very closely resembles the so-called "wedge-
1 Isidorus, quoted by Justus Lipsius "De Militia Roman a." Antverpiae, 1596;
book v. p. 57.
<pb>
tent" of the present time; it was probably supported by two
upright standards and a ridge pole, while the covering stretched
out at the sides, and perhaps also at the bottom or rear of the
tent, was pegged directly to the ground, along the line of its
lower border. As from the shape of the tent, but a small
surface was exposed to the direct force of the wind, stay ropes
were not needed, a great advantage from many points of view.
Indeed, the tent would appear to have been chiefly commendable
for general usage, by reason of the simplicity of its construc-
tion. It may seem as if a tent which requires three poles to
sustain it, is less simple than a tent supported by a single pole;
but this is not the case. No tent can be supported by a single
mast, the covering for which has not been previously prepared
with reference to such a support; while wedge tents may be
made by throwing almost any kind of covering over a bar, lifted
at one or both ends from the ground, and drawing out and
fastening to the ground its dependent borders.
It would appear from the sketch, that the ridge of the Roman
tentorium was protected by a special covering of some sort.
What may have been the particular object of such an arrange-
ment, I am by no means ready to affirm. I may observe,
however, that although the dimensions of this tent are unknown,
it was probably intended to be occupied by eight, perhaps ten
soldiers; it must therefore have had a width and depth of at
least ten feet, with a corresponding height.1 Now, if this tent
had such dimensions, it is very evident, that covered as it was
with skins, no single breadth of these would reach from the
ground to the rjdge-pole. It is by no means improbable, there-
fore, that this kind ]of tent was made in two or three sections—
side pieces, reaching up from the ground to within a foot or two
of the ridge-pole, laced together at the rear of the tent, and
fastened to the ridge-pole above by slings, and a roof piece,
which serving as a hood, completed the covering. Such an
arrangement would have greatly facilitated the transportation of
the tent coverings, which, had they been made in a single piece,
1 "Papilio tegit homines octo."—HTonrtrs Gbohaticus De Castrametatione. "Ut
decern militibus sub uno papilione degentibua."—Vegetius, lib. ii. c. 13.
<pb>
as are our modern canvas tents, must have been very heavy and
cumbersome. Moreover, as these tents were made of a material
absolutely impermeable to air, it would have been quite impos-
sible to have placed a number of soldiers within one, had no
measures been taken to ensure a natural and permanent place of
exit for the air, heated and vitiated by such an assemblage of
men. Supposing the upper part of the tent to have been covered
only by a loosely fitting hood, it will be easy to understand how
greatly such an arrangement must have contributed to the
comfort as well as the health of the occupants of the tentorium.
On the arch of Constantine may be seen, in outline, two conical
tents which in form, as well as by reason of hood-like coverings
at the summits, strikingly resemble some of our modern tents.
Another Roman tent has been pictured upon ancient monu-
ments ; it was round in form, and covered with a sort of dome,
from which the walls fell almost perpendicularly to the ground,
while an ornamental border frequently concealed the line upon
which the roof and curtains met. (See Fig. 10.) This tent would
appear to have had a special name, and to have been perhaps the
most important and considerable of all the tents used in the later
Roman encampments.
Tabernaculum and tentorium are the only words used by the
purest Latin writers, when they may have wished to specify the
kind of shelter employed in encampments.1 Even Frontinus,
who wrote on the "Stratagems of War" (a. d. 86), when speak-
ing of tents, employed only the word tentorium. Some time,
however, within the thirty years which followed the work of this
1 The word prcetorium is often translated tente, tent, &c.; but it has a much
broader meaning than such a translation would indicate, and would be much better
rendered, as Mazeroy has suggested, by quartier-gSnSral—head-quarters, or even by
the words general's quarters, as Gibbon translates it (see " Decline and Fall of the
Roman Empire," book i. c. i.). So, also, it would be improper to render Csesar's
words, depositis in contubemio armis—leaving their arms in their tents. The eon-
tubernium was the soldiers' quarters, or rather, perhaps, the squad occupying those
quarters. The soldier's hut was rarely, if ever, called a taberna; this word belonged
essentially to civil life:—

writer, the word papilio seems to have come into very general
use, either as a name for a special kind of tent, or as a term
applicable to tents in general. The origin of the use of this
word, whether as the name of a special tent, or as a generic term
for tents, is very uncertain. Pliny, I believe, is the first author
who uses the word papilio, but neither he nor those writers on mi-
litary subjects—Hyginus,Modestius,Vegetius—who gave this new
word currency, have taken the trouble to describe the papilio,
and singularly enough, they have not even employed a chance
expression suggestive, in any respect, with regard either to its
origin or its essential and distinctive characteristics. The state-
ment of Isidorus, a writer of the seventh century, that tents were
called papiliones from their resemblance to butterflies,1 has gene-
rally been repeated in subsequent explanations of the meaning of
the word papilio, generally with the additional observation, how-
ever, that the resemblance existed particularly when the walls
of the tent were drawn out on the sides at the doorway, in a
wing-like fashion, as shown ante, Fig. 10.2
1 "Papiliones tentoria dicuntur a similitudine parvi animalis volantis, hie sunt
aviculse."—Isidobus, in Calepinus.
* "Quia expansa vela habet ad similitudinem alarum papilionis" (see Papilio,
"Lexicon" Jacobi Facciolati; Rich, "Roman Antiquities;" Bardin, art. tente).
"Papiliones, pavilions, sont aussi diets tentes, a la semblance d'un oysillon qui vol."
(Robert Valturin, translates de langue Latine en Francoyse, par Loys Meigret,
Lyonnois. Paris, 1555; p. 120.) Schelius gives a reason for the lifting up of the
walls of the papilio. He infers that, as the arms, &c., must have been placed behind
the tents, it would have been very convenient to have had a ready access to them.
"Hence," he thinks, "tentoria took in camps the name of papiliones, because
covered with skins, opened both in front and behind, to furnish a passage-way, the
four flaps or wings of these, when raised up a little, might have had a certain re-
semblance to flying butterflies." "Ac inde, opinor, castrense hoc nomen tentoria
traxerunt, quod binis a fronte et a tergo pellibus in medio ad exitum apertis et divisis,
in modum quatuor alarum tegerentur, quibus hinc paulum allevatis inde papilionum
volantium similitudinem quandam exhiberent." (" Hygini Gromatici de castris Ro-
manes quae exstant," <fcc. Amstelodami,l660. Notae Schelii, p. 2.) Wedgewood suggests
that this name was given to tents because their sides, when flapping, were like the
moving wings of butterflies. Ferrari, however, explains the origin of the word in
another way. He says tents are called papiliones, not because the butterfly spreads
out its wings like a tent, but because papiliones was the generic word for winged
insects, as a protection against the annoyance of which, canopies were attached to
beds; and that from their resemblance to these canopies, military tents obtained
<pb>
It is by no means certain that this presumed resemblance was
one wholly of form. That the papiliones were sometimes highly
ornamented, is evident from an expression—aurati papiliones—
used by Trebellius Pollio;1 it is therefore not improbable
that certain tents may have been first called papiliones, from
their resemblance to butterflies, as well in the richness and
variety of their colours, as in the form sometimes given to
them. But it has been more than intimated that thepapttio pos-
sessed a quality in some respects even more distinctive than those
of form and colour. If Pliny's statement, Numidce vero nomades,
a permutandis papilionibus,2 is suggestive of lightness,—of the
facility with which these constructions were moved, or rather
flew, like butterflies, from place to place,—a passage in Tertullian
attributes this quality to the papilio quite explicitly. "In
time of war, no soldier," says that writer, "is surrounded with
luxuries, nor does he go forth to battle from his couch, but from
the snug and swiftly moved papilio"—sed de papilionibus expeditis
substrictis.3
Papilio and tentorium, and even tabernaculum, having been appa-
rently used as synonymous by Latin writers of the brazen age, it has
been inferred that there was really nodifference in the objects repre-
sented by these words. Hyginus does not certainly indicate any
distinction between them, and this has led Schelius to say, that
papilio was but a common camp name for both the tentorium and
the tabernaculum.* Now, with all due deference to the authority
their new name. "Tentoria dicta sunt papiliones; non quod id animal, dum flores
delibat, alas instar tentorii extendit; sed quod generica voce culices papiliones dicti
sunt: adversu8 quorum tedium conopaea lectis abtenta, a quorum similitudine tentoria
militaria, pariter padiglioni, sunt appellata." Menage (" Dictionnaire Etymologique
de la Langue Francaise ") considers this explanation as satisfactory as any which can
be given.
1 In " Tyrann. Herod." c. 15.
2 Pliny, lib. iii. c. 5. It is only proper that I should say that there is a varia-
tion in the reading of this passage, and that in certain texts pabulis is used instead
of papilionibus.
3 Tertullianus " Adversus Marcionem," lib. iii.
* "Vidi, qui vellet tabernacula principum, gregarii militis papiliones esse, ....
Sed Roman i tam his quam illis tentoria ex pellibus attribuebant quse castrensi
vocabulo papiliones vocabantur" (Rathbodi Hermanni Schelii, "Thesau. Antiq.
Rom." Note in Hyginum); and this opinion was repeated by Schwebelius, one of
<pb>
of that learned but somewhat heavy German commentator, when
we remember that the word papilio suddenly came into use, and
within a period not exceeding fifty years, nearly excluded for
a time from the Latin speech those common words previously
used to indicate tents or the portable shelter employed by
troops, it becomes quite impossible to entertain the opinion he
has expressed. If papilio is simply a synonym of tentorium and
tabernaculum, it is not probable that its introduction into the
vocabulary of the language would have resulted in a temporary
suppression of words previously used to indicate the same object;
this, at least, would have been an exceptional case in the history
of any language. If papilio, shortly after its introduction into
the Latin vocabulary, was used as a synonym for tentorium and
tabernaculum, it was most probably because it first represented a
peculiar kind of tent, and because the new word representing
the new tent was popularly accepted as the symbol for a class of
objects of which it primitively represented but a single type.
If two thousand years hence, most of our literature being lost,
a discussion should arise as to the meaning of the French word
chassepot, it is not unlikely that the weight of written evidence
would incline to the opinion that it was a synonym of the word
fusil. The two words, certainly, as now popularly used, are
nearly or quite synonymous, but the essential difference between
these words is as well understood to-day, as are the special cir-
cumstances which have given to a specific name a signification, in
France, broad enough to include all the fusils with which modern
troops are armed.
Whoever has studied carefully the processes by which lan-
guages are formed—whoever will reflect upon the circumstances
attending the introduction of many of the words newly placed
in the vocabularies of living tongues, will understand how
the commentators of Vegetius. Of the papiliones, he says they were "tentoria ex
pellibus confecta, quibus non gregarii solum milites, sed principes quoque usi
fuerunt." Lipsius speaks vaguely of the distinction to be made between the words
in question; but incidentally quotes, from Procopius, perhaps the strongest passage
which could be offered to show that there was really, at least in the time of that
writer, no difference in the signification of the words: Ipse subito tugurio ex crassis
asseribus compacto, quod papilionem vocant—A hut solidly built of large joists, which
they call a papilio. (" Do Militia Romana," lib. v. p. 58.)
<pb>
readily and naturally even the name papilio, given to a new kind
of tent, may have been used in the course of a few years to indi-
cate a tent, without reference to its special form or qualities. To
suppose that a new name was given to an old object, is highly im-
probable—as improbable as that a resemblance to a " butterfly," so
striking as to cause that name to be given to the tent, and to be
immediately and universally adopted, had never been observed by
any one, during the three or four hundred years preceding,
during which Roman armies had habitually encamped in tentoriis.
Moreover, during the middle ages, the words padiglione,
pavilion, and pavilion, which are the Italian, French, and English
derivatives of papilio, were always used by the chroniclers of
those times, when speaking of the tents of the nobles—tents
alike remarkable for their size and elegance; but were never
used to indicate the tents of the common soldiers. This fact is
important, as it is hardly probable, had papilio never signified
anything more than the tent used for several centuries by
common soldiers, in the Roman and Gallo-Roman armies, that
its immediate derivatives would have been employed only when
a reference was made to the large and richly-furnished tents of
officers.1
As for the kind of covering employed in making the tents
first called papiliones, no information has reached us. All we
may say is, that from the time of Hyginus (a. d. 120), until
after the fall of the Empire, Roman armies, when encamped, were
1 The only explanation of the distinction to be made between the papilio and the
tentorium, which I have met with, may be found in Calepinus and Facciolatue. Says
the first authority:—" Inter tentorium et papilionem hoc est discriminis, quod ten-
torium proprie dicitur, quod ad brevem moram figitur, papilio vero est ad diu morandum
aptum tabernaculum." Between a tentorium and a papilio there is this difference,
that the tentorium, properly speaking, was a shelter established as a temporary
expedient, while the papilio was a sort of tabernaculum, fit for a much longer and
more permanent service. Says Facciolatus :—" Si discrimen est inter papiliones et
tentoria, fortasse est, quod illi minoris molis et apparatus sint." If any distinction
is to be made between the two words, it is, perhaps, because the papiliones may
have been smaller, and fitted up with less gearing. It will be noticed that these
attempts to establish a difference in the signification of the words are founded upon
quite different, if not absolutely contradictory, ideas as regards the essential character
of the papilio.
<pb>
said to have been sub papilionibus, perhaps more frequently than
they were said to have been in tentoriis, or even sub pellibus.
It does not necessarily follow that skins were no longer
used in the construction of tents; but if the term papilio
was first suggested by the peculiar form, or colour, or light-
ness, of a certain class of tents, it is also highly probable
that the material of which the coverings of these tents were
made, was unlike that used in the construction of the com-
mon tentorium. It would have certainly been difficult with
a covering of skins, to have obtained these graceful effects of
drapery, presumed to characterize the papilio; nor would it
have been easy to have given to skins, that diversity of colour
which might readily have been obtained by the employment of
woven fabrics; and above all, it would have been impossible to
have secured that lightness so indispensable to their easy and
rapid transportation.
Now, it is a very remarkable fact, that no writer, who may
have written previously to the period in which the word papilio
began to be used, has spoken of Roman tents made of any
woven material. It is true that Cicero, in his second oration
against Verres, accuses Verres, among other corrupt practices,
of having, late in the season, and as a matter of mere luxury,
"commanded tabernacula of fine linen to be pitched along the
shore,just as he was accustomed to do in the summer."1 But it
would be forcing the translation to say that he commanded
linen tents to be pitched. As the tabernacula were not erected
for military purposes, but simply for the pleasure of Verres and
his associates, Cicero may have only referred to a kind of
summer-house provided with linen awnings.
Nor are Virgil's lines—
"Nec procul hinc Rhesi niveis tentoria velis
Agnoecit lachrymans"*—
(" The tents of Rhesus next his grief renew,
By their white sails betrayed to nightly view."—Dryden.)—
1 "Tabernacula, quemadmodum consueverat temporibus testivis, carbaseis intenta
velis, colloeari jussit in littore."—Cickeo, Second Oration against Verres, c. xxxi.
* "JEneid," lib. i. 469-70.
U
<pb>
to be accepted as authority for stating that the camp of the
Rhetians, before Troy, was composed of linen tents. Niveis
tentoria velis is only a poetical expression, although the tents
might well have had "white sails," without being of canvas.
Again, in the third Georgic these lines occur:—
"Cinyphii tondent hirci, setasque comantes;
Usum in castrorum et miseris velamina nautis."1
(" Meantime the pastor shears their hoary beards;
And eases of their hair the loaded herds.
Their camelots, warm in tents, the soldier hold,
And shield the shivering mariner from cold."—Dryden.)
Dryden has, doubtless, perfectly rendered the meaning of usum
in castrorum, although the expression has been supposed to refer
to the employment of goats'-hair cloth in the construction of tents.
Indeed, De Perrin seems to have felt, so confidently, that such
was its meaning, that he makes it the text for quite a dissertation
on the "two kinds of coarse cloth used by the ancients in the
construction of tents," felt, and the pannus cymatilis, and con-
cludes that it was customary to employ tents of woven stuffs
in camps established in the summer, while tents of skins were
employed in the construction of winter encampments.2 But the
three citations which I have here given, are the only ones which
I have been able to make from the whole body of classic Latin
literature, in which cloth is stated, either directly or indirectly,
to have been used by the Romans in the construction of tents.2
1 Georgics, lib. iii. 312-13.
8 De Perrin, " Dissertation sur les Tentes," pp. 23-27.
5 Several writers, among others M. Michel Levy, have included the conopeum
among Roman tents. This'is a mistake. The conopeum was a bed canopy, or a
mosquito netting, rather than a tent. It had an Eastern or Egyptian origin, and its
use at Rome was always considered a foreign practice, and thus a subject for
satire:—
"Interque signa turpe militaria
Sol aspicit conopeum."—Hoe. Epod. ix.
"Fcedaque Tarpeio conopea tendere saxo."
Pbopeh. lib. iii. El. 9.
The distinction to be made between a tabernaculum—tent, and a conopeum—bed canopy,
is clearly recognized in the Vulgate Bible. "Duxeruntque illam ad tabernaculam
<pb>
The Roman soldier's tent in the armies of the Consuls and
of Caesar was made of skins or leather, whether for summer or
winter use; and it should be observed that this tent was never
spoken of except as a tabernaculum or tentorium.
There is every reason to believe, as I have elsewhere remarked,
that tents of woven stuffs were in general use among the popula-
tions of western Asia, during many centuries before the Christian
era; at least, the art of weaving not only originated in the East,
but had there been extensively practised from a very remote
period; while among the Romans, at no time, does it appear to
have held any considerable place among the industries of common
life. It was only after their Asiatic conquests that the various
fabrics, for which the East had long been famous, became
among them articles of use and common traffic.
The vast magnitude which this commerce assumed under the
Empire, is well known to those acquainted with Roman history.1
It becomes highly probable, therefore, that one of the results of
the increased distribution, at this time, of the products of Eastern
workmanship, was the employment of certain kinds of woven
stuffs in the construction of tents, which, lighter, more graceful in

Judith had cut off the head of Holofernes she exhibited it to her people, together
with a piece of this canopy, saying: —" Ecce caput Holofernis, principis militife

see Athenseus, op. cit. p. 525. Says M. Renan:—" Ionia, in the first century,
was densely populated, and covered with cities and villages. Powerful associations
of workmen, similar to those of Italy and Flanders in tho middle ages, elected their
chiefs, raised public monuments, erected statues, created works of public utility,
founded institutions of charity, and exhibited all the signs of prosperity, welfare, and
moral activity. Around the manufacturing cities, such as Thyatira, Philadelphia,
and Hierapolis, devoted to the great industries of Asia, the fabrication of tapestries,
of woollens, and of leather, and the dyeing of stuffs, a rich agriculture was developed,"

relating to Soman commerce with Asia, early in the Christian era, may be found in
Gibbon's "Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire," book i. c. 2; but for a full and
complete exposition, consult Heeren, "De la Politique et du Commerce des

form, and richer in colour than the old tents of skins, may have
received the new name of papiliones. Such tents may have been
first used by officers; doubtless the largest and richest models
were always employed by them alone; but it is probable that,
very soon after the introduction of the officers' papilio, tents
similar to that construction, in many general respects, began to
be issued to the troops, and that, as a consequence, and almost
immediately, the words tabernaculum and tentorium fell into dis-
use, and the new word papilio became a generic name for tent
in the written as well as spoken Roman language.1
In speaking of the form of the papilio I have elsewhere referred
to fig. 10, on page 276. It is very probable, for the reasons
already given, that this figure may represent its primitive form.
And tents of this form have even been supposed to be those
most common in Roman camps ;2 but the tent represented in the
1 I do not wish to convey the idea that the words tabernaeulum, tentorium and
sub pellibus were at any time obsolete; they may be found not unfrequently in
writers who wrote long after Hyginus. Some of these, even, do not employ the word
papilio. Thus Ammianus Marcellinus, who wrote at the close of the fourth century,
speaks often of tentoria, and even of encampments sub pellibus, but never once of the
papilio; and yet he was a contemporary of Vegetius, who, in his treatise "De Re
Militari," scarcely uses any other word than papilio, when he has occasion to indicate
a tent. Indeed, there is reason to believe that sub pellibus may have been in use, as
an archaic or poetic form of expression, long after it had ceased to be descriptive of
the material of which tents were commonly made. One can easily understand why
Pacatus, in praise of Theodosius, should have alluded to the "hy ernes aetas sub pelli-
bus;" and why Claudian, in his adulatory verses, written as late as the fifth century,
should have credited the Vandal Stilicon with having inured his legions to a discipline
even more rigorous than was practised in the days of Brutus and Valerius:—
"Quoties sub pellibus egit
Edonas hyemes, et tardi flabra Bootse
Sub dio Rhipsea tulit," &c.
Still the word papilio grew into such general use, as to find its way into the Greek
language, and to be able to hold ita place, in the vocabularies of the monkish chroni-
clers. Du Cange closes a long list of references to the use of this word by such
writers by, "et alii sine numero." The word also occurs in the Vulgate :—" Datham
et Abiron egressi stabant in introitu papilionum suorum," <fcc.
2 "La Militia Romana di Polibio, di Tito Livio, e di Dionigi Alicarnaseo," da Fran-
cesco Patricii. Ferrara, 1583. See also the engravings in the magnificent edition
of Clarke's "Cassar," published in London, in 1712, by Tonson. These round,

figure would seem to be less fitted for common service than for
the use of officers of rank; even its form would indicate such a
usage, for we have it on the authority of Josephus, that "the
tent of the general was like a little temple,"1 a vague description,
certainly, but we know that Roman temples were commonly
round and surmounted by dome-shaped roofs. Indeed, it is
by no means certain that fig. 9 on page 276 does not show the
form of the papilio in most common use among the troops of
the Empire, or at least the one to which Hyginus refers when
he says:—" It is ten feet wide and ten feet deep, each shelters
eight men; ten must be allowed to a centuria of eighty
soldiers." *
and seventeenth centuries; they have, however, no historical value except as re-
presentations of the tents in use at the period when the sketches were made.
It is a remarkable fact that historical accuracy in composition rarely seems to have
been observed by the most eminent designers of the sixteenth and even seventeenth
centuries; it was then, those splendidly illustrated Dutch Bibles were appearing, in
which the antediluvians are represented as living in Flemish houses, and Moses as
having been taken out of the Nile, at a point where the narrow tortuous stream
winds among wild, rocky hills, whose flanks are covered with pines and birches, and
whose summits are picturesquely crowned with Rhenish castles and watch-towers.
Rhodes has been careless enough to suppose, that the representations of encampments
and tents in Clarke's " Cassar " were historically accurate. Accordingly, ho tells us
that "the army of Ariovistus, a king of the Germans, used huts and tents similar
to those represented in Froissart," &c.; as also, that among " various other tents
used in Caesar's wars, are shown three tents of the exact form now used in England—
the old pattern round tents, without the improved short wall." This surprising
similarity in the forms of ancient and comparatively modern tents, is explained by
the almost universal custom among the artists, at the time referred to, of represent-
ing the subjects of ancient history, by modern and familiar symbols. Thus, the most
common form of the Roman soldier's tent, shown in Clarke's engravings, is a long
wedge-tent capable of sheltering a whole company; such a tent is neither described
by any Roman writer, nor exhibited on any Roman monument, but was well known in
Italy and Germany during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

2 The work of Hyginus Gromaticus "De Castrametatione commences, rather
abruptly, with these words: "Nunc papilionum tensionem cohortium superscrip-
tarum ostendimus. Papilio unus occupat pedes decern, accepit incrementum tensurse
pedes duos, tegit homines octo; plena centuria habet milites octoginta, erunt papi-
liones decern."
It is remarkable that Schelius, in his plan of a section of a Roman camp, should
have given to the papilio the form shown in fig. 8, p. 275. Hyginus says there were

It is a curious fact that the Romans seem never to have imi-
tated, either the people of the East or the Greeks, in the use of
magnificent tents. A passage in Suetonius has been referred
to,1 in which Julius Caesar is said to have taken with him, on
certain expeditions, mosaic floorings, as if these were to be used
to embellish his prcetoria or pavilions ;a but I remember no in-
stance, in the course of my own reading, in which classic writers
have mentioned the use of such tents by Roman generals. Even
Claudian refers to the painted and begemmed tents of the East
with a sort of contempt,3 and tells us, that Honorius did not
use gilded awnings in his camp to keep the sun off.4
We have descriptions of the splendid tents of Herod, King of
Palmyra, and of Antiochus, and of other kings, at war with Rome;
but Roman tent architecture would appear to have always been
very strictly limited to a realization of the forms most useful and
serviceable in the field.
but two feet between the tents as they stood together side by side in line—accepit
incrementum tensurce pede3 duos; they could not, therefore, have been supported by
side stay ropes; but we are told that they covered an area of ten square feet—scru-
pulum itaque terrw occupat. (Schelius, not. in Hyg.) Now no tents covering a
square area can be made secure without stay ropes at the sides, except those having
a wedge or pyramidal form, unless sustained on the inside by a strong framework;
and such tents, as we have elsewhere stated, were called tabernacula. The papiliones
mentioned by Hyginus must, therefore, have been either wedge-shaped or pyramidal
tents, or a sort of tent-barracks. That Eoman camps in the time of Hyginus were
generally laid out in view of the employment of a comparatively non-portable shelter,
is scarcely probable. If papilio was at any time a common camp-name for a tent,
there is reason for believing, from the indications of Hyginus, that he refers simply
to a tentorium, the form of which may be seen in fig. 9.

2 "In expeditionibus tesselata et sectilia pavimenta circumtulisse." (Suetonius,
"Life of Csesar," c. xlvi.) Admitting this statement to be true, there can be very
little reason for supposing the pavimenta were to be employed in tents. It is
altogether more probable, that they were intended to be used in the construction of
those public buildings, which the Romans were in the habit of erecting, in conquered
provinces, alike as records of their military successes and symbols of imperial power.

Of the interior arrangement of the Roman soldiers' tent, we
know very little. The soldiers probably made themselves as
comfortable as they could in the straw which, according to
Pliny, was at least occasionally spread upon the ground,1 and
the generals also, are said to have had sometimes no better
furnished quarters.2
Lipsius laughs at the idea of any special bedding, and begs his
interrogator not to bother him with such nonsense.2 Indeed, it
is only after the establishment of the Empire of the East, the
relaxation of military discipline, and the general enervation of
the people, that we learn the soldier no longer used, as formerly,
a stone for a pillow, but feather-beds and spring mattresses.*
HERE are many reasons for believing, that tents continued
to be considered an indispensable part of the equipment
of Roman armies, until the fall of the Western Empire
(a.d. 476). It is probable also that the Gothic kings, who
adopted in a measure the Roman tactics and arms, made use of
tents for the shelter of their troops.
In the Empire of the East, where many of the arts of life con-
tinued to flourish, and where for a long time Roman military
customs were at least nominally observed, tents always appear
to have been considered as essential to the proper equipment of
an army. The Emperors Maurice and Leon, and other Byzantine
writers, distinctly state that the whole imperial army was, at the
time of their writing (a. d. 590-900) provided with tents.8 So

in that curious old Greek " Chronicle of the Wars of the French
in the Morea"—wars carried on from 1204 until 1296—we learn
that tents were used by the imperial troops, as also that those of
the chiefs were more or less imposing.1
Whether, at the time of the fall of the Western Empire, and
for several succeeding centuries, tents of skins or canvas were in
general use in the armies of the several warlike races, then inha-
biting central and western Europe, is very doubtful. The Goths
would appear at times to have made use of tents; while the
Huns, perpetually on horseback, had little occasion to use them.2
Indeed, Jornandes makes but a single allusion to a tent—intra
tentoria serica—that, in which the body of Attila was placed after
his death.3
Ammianus Marcellinus speaks of the presence of tents in
German camps, at the time of the expedition undertaken by
Jovian in the year 367,4 and other writers have spoken of tents
in describing the historical events special to Germany and Gaul
at a later time. But very little is known of the shelter em-
ployed, even in the armies of the Merovingian kings. Tents are
sometimes mentioned, as if their use was known, but they
appear to have often been mere booths, ex ramis factis, as de-
scribed by Gregory of Tours.8 Nor is it certain that the troops
of Charlemagne were better sheltered, although it is probable
that in the time of that sovereign, princes made use of tents, and
even of splendid tents. At least, we are told that on a certain
occasion, Haroun-al-Raschid sent many rich presents to Charle-
magne, among which were a wonderful clock, an elephant, and a
magnificent tent;6 and it seems the elephant and the clock were
regarded as the greater curiosities.7 It is most probable that,

until the eleventh century, feudal troops were generally en-
camped au bivouac, or quartered upon the inhabitants.1
According to Strutt the Anglo-Saxons were acquainted with
the use of tents, and he has reproduced sketches of two rude
bell-shaped tents from an old Anglo-Saxon manuscript. "From
the appearance," says he, "of these tents in the delineation,
I should fancy they were covered over with a thick strong cloth
or leather."8 It is quite probable that tents of skin, possibly
of cloth, were occasionally made use of by the Anglo-Saxons;
perhaps even they may have been used by the Britons. It is
very certain, however, from the almost complete absence of
allusions to tents in English chronicles written previously to the
eleventh century, that their use must have been very limited.
The general use of tents, in the armies of western Europe,
probably dates from the time of the first Crusade; although
there are many reasons for believing, as I may subsequently
have occasion to show, that if the practice of encamping under
tents was not borrowed directly from the Byzantines and the
Saracens, it was at least during the Crusades generalized in the
Christian armies, by the local circumstances of climate and cus-
tom, as well as by the discovery of varieties in tent architecture,
with which the west was previously unacquainted.
Among the evidences of the enthusiasm with which the project
of Peter the Hermit was welcomed, it is said, that everywhere
might be seen the assembling of horses, the making of tents and
pavilions, and the preparation of arms; and, that speedily this
enthusiasm became so general, that:—" There was no route, no
city, no plain, which was not covered with the tents and pavilions
of a multitude of barons and knights, and men and women of all
conditions."3

We are told that the Franks invested Antioch from October
to June (a.d. 1097), "pitching their tents around the walls."1
And again, on Baldwin's march to Jerusalem, the troops are

the severity of the cold, never getting under cover during
several successive days. For this calamity, indeed, there was no
remedy, as there was a deficiency both of tents and of wood." 2 A
hundred years later, the army of Richard encountered a similar
hardship, on nearly the same spot:—" Then the rain and hail
began to beat upon the men, and killed many of their beasts
of burden. The storm was so violent, that it tore up the pegs of
the tents, drowned the horses, and spoiled all their biscuit and
bacon. The armour and coats of mail also were so rusted, that
the greatest labour was necessary to restore them to their former
brightness; their clothes were drenched by the wet, and the
men themselves suffered from the unwonted severity of the cli-
mate."3 "At the dawn of day, the men with the tents were
sent forward, and the rest of the army followed. This day was
the 20th of January, and they encamped for the night, every
man as well as he was able."4 These two passages, taken from
Geoffry de Vinsauf, show very clearly that the whole army of
Richard Coeur de Lion was furnished with tents. Indeed, the
chronicles of the period are full of allusions to tents, although
they generally refer to a class of which I shall soon have occa-
sion to speak. It is said that William the Conqueror, when he
landed at Hastings, encamped his army in tents.8 We are alike
ignorant, however, of their number, and of their special qualities;
it is only at a somewhat later period, that we begin to obtain the

details necessary for a just appreciation of the character of me-
diaeval encampments.
The camp of King Edward II., at the time of his expedition to
Scotland, in 1301, is thus described in an ancient French poem,
the "Siege of Caerleverok:"—" The army being drawn up, and
the mareschal having marked out the ground, and assigned to
every one his proportion, then might be seen to arise houses of
various fashions, built without the assistance of carpenters or
masons, and composed of white and dyed linen; there many a
cord was stretched, and many a pin driven into the earth, and
many a large tree felled to build huts, whose floors within were
strewed with leaves, herbs, and flowers gathered in the woods."1
It is difficult to say whether tents or huts were most numerous
in this particular camp; at any rate, the number of tents must
have been considerable.
These tents would appear also to have been, according to the
custom of that time, furnished at the expense of those using
them, since in the account which Froissart gives us of "How
(in 1327) the King of England left the city of York with all his
host to go into Scotland," orders were given by the King, that
every one should prepare, during a week's time, waggons and
tents for the field:—"And then each one provided himself as
best he was able, according to his estate." 2 That most of those
who were engaged upon this expedition were, however, without
tents, soon becomes evident from the sufferings they endured
from the exposure, consequent upon their inability to find a
shelter of any kind.3 Froissart, however, alludes very fre-
quently to the use of tents in European armies, from 1325 to
1400, the period which furnishes the incidents of his Chronicles;
but they would generally appear, as at the siege of Caerleverok,
to have been associated with huts, and bowers, and a variety of
temporary expedients to obtain a shelter.
Indeed, Froissart, Monstrelet, and the French chroniclers of
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, generally speak of the
1 Cited from Grose. Op. cit. vol. ii. p. 11.
2 "Chroniques de J. Froissart," liv. i. c. xxxiii.
3 Ibidem, c. xxxviii.
<pb>
lodgings of the troops—leurs logis; and they very often, in
speaking of an encampment, refer to the lodgings- and tents; as,
for example, "chacun saillit hors de sa tente et de son logis."1
From the incidental statements and expressions of these writers,
we may quite rightly infer that tents in mediaeval camps were
very generally the property of the nobles, and that the troops
were usually quartered in the houses of the country or in tem-
porary huts, or bowers of bushes and the branches of trees.
Whenever sieges threatened to be of long continuance, huts
certainly seem to have been preferred. Thus, when Edward III.
laid siege to Calais in 1346, he ordered "hotels and houses"
to be built between the city and the river, made of planks, and
roofed with straw and broom, and "as well placed and arranged
in streets, as if he had intended to remain there a dozen years."
There was, moreover, in this new city, which the King called
Ville-Neuve la Hardie, everything necessary to a host ; and
besides, a market-place, merceries, meat-shops, cloth-shops,
bakeries, and "all other needful things, which one could easily
get for money."2 So, in 1386, the French making gigantic prepa-
rations for an invasion of England, the Constable assembled
an army in Brittany; and "Everything was on such a grand
scale, that in order to lodge the troops on landing in England, a
wooden city had been prepared, all the parts of which could be
united on the spot."3 But the expedition failed and the "belle
ville de bois'' fell into the hands of the Duke of Burgundy.
Again, at the siege of Granada, in 1481, it is said that the
camp of Ferdinand was of a quadrangular form, "divided into
streets like a city, the troops being quartered in tents, and in
booths constructed of bushes and branches of trees."4
But if huts were preferred, under many circumstances, tents
appear to have been occasionally used by the troops, as well as

by their commanders. Thus, we are told that the Duke of
Orleans was compelled, in 1406, to abandon the siege of Gui-
enne, because, among other reasons, the rain had destroyed the
tents—les pluies avaient pourri les tentes.1 According to Monstre-
let, when John, Duke of Burgundy, was about to lay siege to
Ham (1411), he obtained from the cities of Flanders fifty thou-
sand fighting men, well armed and equipped. They had twelve
thousand waggons and carts to carry their baggage. The Duke
awaited the assembling of his forces under the tents and pavilions
which he had pitched on a plain near Marguion. He was par-
ticularly interested in watching the coming in of the Flemish
communes, which made a great show, and encamped in the most
orderly manner:—" To see their tents, the number was so large, one
would have thought the encampments to be real and great cities."s
So Drayton, in referring to the immense booty captured by
the English at Agincourt, in 1415, says:—
"Wagons and carts were heaped until they crackt
With arms and tents, there taken in the field."5
On Edward's crossing into France, in 1475, his camp equipage
seems to have been remarkably complete:—" Nothing could be
finer than the English army, supplied with trains of every sort,
tents, waggons, and workmen to pitch the tents and take care of
the camp." *
In the wars between the Hungarians, the Tartars, and the
Turks, in the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries, tents
appear to have been largely used by the combatants on all sides.
In 1241 the Tartars are said to have pitched their tents only a
few miles from Buda, and in 1345, to have moved again on
Pesth "in such numbers that their tents covered a space of

3 In the rolls of Parliament (1423) are two items concerning tente, inserted into
a schedule and valuation of furniture belonging to Henry V.:
"Item—2 tentes de bloy carde linez de toile linge queux furent au 8r Herry

eleven miles." 1 The Hungarians would seem also to have been
well provided with tents at this time, as they are mentioned very
frequently in connection with their movements, and in such a
way, as to leave the impression that they were scarcely inferior,
either in number or excellence, to those used in the Turkish
armies.
Indeed, the use of tents during the middle ages, appears to
have been most considerable in those European armies, which
were brought most frequently and immediately in contact with
the Turks and Saracens.
Perhaps the most remarkable accounts of camps and camp life
in the middle ages, are preserved in certain Spanish manuscripts
which Washington Irving has attributed to one Fray Antonio Aga-
pida, and which he at least has made a part of our own literature,
under the title of " A Chronicle of the Conquest of Granada."
There we are told:—" While the holy Christian army was
beleaguering this infidel city of Baza, through the wonderful
activity, judgment, and enterprise of this heroic and magnanimous
woman (Isabella) a great host encamped in the heart of a war-
like country, accessible only over mountain roads, was main-
tained in continual abundance. Nor was it supplied merely with
the necessaries and comforts of life; the powerful escorts drew
merchants and artificers from all parts, to repair as if in caravans
to this great military market. Here might be seen cunning
artificers in steel, and accomplished armourers achieving those
rare and sumptuous helmets, and cuirasses richly gilt, inlaid and
embossed, in which the Spanish cavaliers delighted; saddlers
and harness-makers and horse-mttliners also, whose tents glit-
tered with gorgeous housings and caparaisons. The merchants
spread forth their sumptuous silks, cloths, brocades, fine linen,
and tapestry. The tents of the nobility were prodigally
decorated with all kinds of the richest stuffs, and dazzled the
eye with their magnificence; nor could the grave looks and
grave speeches of King Ferdinand prevent his youthful cavaliers
from vying with each other in the splendour of their dress and
caparaisons, on all occasions of parade and ceremony.

"While the Christian camp, thus gay and gorgeous, spread
itself out like a holiday pageant before the walls of Baza, while
a long line of beasts of burden, laden with provisions and
luxuries, were seen descending the valley from morning till
night, and pouring into the camp a continued stream of abund-
ance, the unfortunate garrison found their resources rapidly
wasting away, and famine already began to pinch the peaceful
part of the community. Cidy Yahye had acted with great spirit
and valour, as long as there was any prospect of success, but he
began to lose his usual fire and animation, and was observed to
pace the walls of Baza with a pensive air, casting many a wistful
look towards the Christian camp, and sinking into profound
reveries and cogitations. The veteran Alcayde, Mohammed ben
Hassan, noticed these desponding moods and endeavoured to
rally the spirits of the prince. 'The rainy season is at hand,'
would he cry; 'the floods will soon pour down from the moun-
tains; the rivers will overflow their banks and inundate the
valleys. The Christian king already begins to waver; he dare
not linger and encounter such a season, in a plain cut up by
valleys and rivulets. A single wintry storm from our moun-
tains would wash away his canvas city, and sweep off those gay
pavilions like wreaths of snow before the blast!'
"The Prince Cidy Yahye took heart at these words, and
counted the days as they passed, until the stormy season should
commence. As he watched the Christian camp, he beheld it one
morning in universal commotion. There was an unusual sound
of hammers in every part, as if some new engine of war were
constructing. At length, to his astonishment, the walls and
roofs of houses began to appear above the bulwarks. In a little
while there were above a thousand edifices of wood and plaster
erected, covered with tiles taken from the demolished towers of
the orchards, and bearing the pennons of various commanders
and cavaliers; while the common soldiery constructed huts of
clay and branches of trees, and thatched them with straw.
Thus, to the dismay of the Moors, within four days the light
tents and gay pavilions, which had whitened their hills and
plains, passed away like summer clouds; and the unsubstantial
camp assumed the solid appearance of a city laid out in streets and
<pb>
squares. In the centre rose a large edifice, which overlooked the
whole, and the royal standard of Arragon and Castile, proudly
floating above it, showed it to be the palace of the king."
In this description reference is made to nearly all the kinds of
shelter common to camps at that period, the prodigally decorated
tents of the nobility, the canvas city of the soldiery—which, as
the siege continued and the season of storms approached, gave
place to the edifices of wood, the quarters of the officers, and the
huts of clay and branches of trees thatched with straw, occupied
by the common soldiery.
One of the interesting facts noted in this extract, is the pre-
sence in the Spanish camp of "cunning artificers" and mer-
chants with "sumptuous silks, cloths, brocades, fine linen, and
tapestry." The natural inference is that many, perhaps most,
of the tents were made in the camp itself. Indeed, this custom
would seem to have prevailed very generally at the time of
which I am speaking.
In an old manuscript,1 which contains a schedule of the rates
of pay accorded to the several services in the army of Edward
before Calais, there is an entry as follows:—"314 masons, car-
penters, locksmiths, machinists, tent-makers, miners, armourers,
cannoneers and artillerymen." The tent-makers thus appear to
have constituted a special service in the well-organized and
equipped armies of the period.8
The age of chivalry was pre-eminently an age of individualism,
whoever had power showed the world he had it; while those who
had wealth or physical strength, were held in estimation very
much in proportion as they were prodigal in the use of these
possessions. A knight, distinguished for his courage, strength
and skill, was no less honoured by the splendour of his arms.
An ostentatious rivalry was thus encouraged, the result of which
was that every assembly of armed men became a pageant, and
1 See note in " Chroniques de Froissart," ed. Panth.; tome i. p. 274.
* It always seems to have been a common custom in the East to have had large
numbers of tent-makers in the train of armies. Fifty tent-makers are mentioned as
required to accompany the "camp equipage for journies" of the kings of Persia, by
Gladwin, in his "Ayeen Akbery."
<pb>
every camp a theatre of semi-barbaric magnificence and dis-
play.
We have just seen how, in their camp before Baza, the Spanish
cavaliers vied with each other in the splendour of their equipments;
but this rivalry was not limited to a single occasion; splendid
armour, costly trappings, and magnificent tents were to be found
in' every camp in Europe, and were even considered the indis-
pensable insignia of royalty and of rank. Thus in the Chronicle
of Fray Agapida, from which I have just made an extract, we
are told that the camp before Granada " made a glorious appear-
ance in the setting sun. The warriors' tents of the royal family
and attendant nobles were adorned with rich hangings, having
sumptuous devices, and with costly furniture, forming, as it were,
a little city of silk and brocade, where the pinnacles of pavilions,
of various gay colours, surmounted with waving standards and
fluttering pennons, might vie with the domes and minarets of the
capital they were besieging. In the midst of this gaudy metro-
polis, the lofty tent of the Queen domineered over the rest like
a stately palace. The Marquis of Cadiz had courteously surren-
dered his own tent to the Queen. It was the most complete
and splendid in Christendom, and had been carried about with
him throughout the war. In the centre rose a stately alfaneque
or pavilion in Oriental taste, the rich hangings being supported
by columns of lances ornamented with martial devices. This
centre pavilion or silken tower was surrounded by other com-
partments, some of painted linen, fined with silk, and all sepa-
rated from each other by curtains. It was one of those camp
palaces which are raised and demolished in an instant, like the
city of canvas which surrounds them." 1
One might well suppose the worthy Father Agapida, in de-
scribing these pavilions, had given to them all the grace, beauty,
and fairy-like magnificence peculiar to the old Moorish capital
itself; or that he had innocently sketched, according to his own
fancy, a kingly encampment in some happy land of enchantment,
which he would fain believe had appeared for once as a reality

<pb>
beneath the walls of infidel Granada. But no, the old chronicler
has only stated the facts, and the loftiness of his style even, was
probably partly occasioned by a profound sense of the richness
and dignity of his subject. On referring to contemporaneous
French and English history, we find frequent accounts of similar
exhibitions of the fondness for ostentatious display which charac-
terized those times. Thus we are told by M. de Barrante, that
Charles the Bold set out upon his campaign against the Swiss in
1476 "with the finest train of artillery that had ever been seen.
As for the baggage of the army it was immense. His tents and
pavilions were resplendent with gold and silk. His own tent was
surrounded by four hundred others, where lodged the seigneurs of
his court and the attendants of his house. Without, shone his coat
of arms adorned with pearls and precious stones; within, the tent
was hung with red velvet, embroidered with foliage in gold and
pearls; windows in which the glass was framed in bars of gold
had been put into it; within, was the chair of state, where, seated,
he received the ambassadors and held meetings of ceremony; it
was of massive gold. His coats of armour, his swords, his poig-
nards, his lances mounted in ivory, were wonderfully worked, and
their handles sparkled with rubies, sapphires, and emeralds. His
seal weighed two marcs of gold, his portfolio, bound in velvet,
contained the picture of the Duke Philip and his own; on his
collar of the Fleece of Gold, the flashes of the guns were repre-
sented by rubies. All these objects were within his tent, as well
as an infinite number of articles of furniture and precious jewels,
which fell into the hands of the Swiss.
"His chapel tent contained almost as many things of value.
Here were the shrines and the reUcs which had excited the admi-
ration of Germany two years before; the twelve apostles in
silver, the shrine of St. Andrew in crystal, and an ostensoir of
marvellous richness."1
A hundred years before, Philip the Hardy had made a display
of tents at Lelinghen almost equally remarkable. "Here," says
M. de Barrante, "the Duke found a new occasion to show all
1 "Histoires des Dues de Bourgogne," par M. de Barrante; tome xi. livre vii,
p. 28.
<pb>
his magnificence. His tent, made of boards and painted canvas,
had the form of a castle flanked with towers. His whole suite,
numbering 3,000 persons, were provided with lodgings in the
neighbourhood, these lodgings were separated by streets, so that
his encampment had quite the aspect of a city."1
And still earlier, in the war between Charles, King of Naples,
and Conradin, son of Conrad, Emperor of Germany, which took
place in 1268, not only were all the troops well supplied with
tents, but many magnificent ones appeared upon the field; and
so rich were some of these, that on the defeat of the Germans, it is
said, the King gave orders that each soldier should guard the
booty he had taken, he himself being quite satisfied to receive,
as his share, the splendid tent of Conradine, which was supported
by ten columns, and the treasure within it.2
And who has not heard of the interview, which took place in
1519, between Francis the First and Henry the Eighth, near the
little towns of Ardres and Guines, on a spot which, from the
richness of the tents there used, was afterwards known as the
"Field of Cloth of Gold?" Here were pitched several hundred
tents, all the finest and most magnificent it was possible to be-
hold :—" For there was nothing used but cloth of gold, and
silver, and velvet; and all were emblazoned with the arms of
the Princes, and the lords, and ladies, to whom they belonged."
"The principal ones," says the Marshal de Fleurange, "were
of cloth of gold frisi inside and out, both rooms, halls, and gal-
leries; and the whole field was covered with tents of cloth of
gold ras, and stuffs worked in gold and silver."
The tent which was pitched for his Most Christian Majesty,
was sixty feet long by as many wide, with a pavilion at each of
its four angles; the outside, was covered with cloth of gold and
finely embroidered stuffs, and the inside, was lined with blue velvet.

"Et la etoient de toutes lea deux parties tendues tentes, trefs, pavilions, pour eux

<pb>
Upon the highest point of the tent was an image of St. Michael,
gilded with the finest gold.
The tent of the King of England, although perhaps less magni-
ficent, did not fail to agreeably surprise those who saw it. It
was built of wood, and covered with tapestry; it was divided
into four great apartments, so arranged as to be lighted from all
sides, since there was nothing but glass between the columns
which supported it, which were painted in imitation of various
coloured marbles. The interior of this tent was also mag-
nificently furnished.1 Strutt has given representations of these
tents, taken from an illuminated manuscript in the Cotton
Library. "The English tent," he says, "was made of a rich
crimson, embroidered and wrought into ornaments of gold; and
all around, at the bottom of the roof, is a rich fringe of gold and
crimson silk; above the fringe is a narrow compartment like a
moulding, which runs all around the tent, in which is written in
letters of gold, dev et mon dboiet: semper vivat in .etekno;
and on the top is a running ornament carved and richly gilt, with
the lion, the hart, the greyhound, and the dragon, alternately
holding little banners, with the crown and the fleur-de-lys at the
top; on these little banners are the arms of England, roses, and
the portcullis."2
It may be interesting to compare these descriptions with one
to be found in Gladwin's "Khojeh Abdul Kurreern," but which
I reproduce from Major Rhodes' "Tents and Tent-life."
"Nadir Shah, out of the abundance of his spoils, caused a tent to
be made of such beauty and magnificence as to be almost beyond
the power of language to describe. The outside was covered
with fine scarlet cloth; the lining was of violet coloured satin,
on which were representations of all the birds and beasts in the
creation, with trees and flowers, the whole being composed of
pearls, diamonds, rubies, emeralds, amethysts and other precious
stones; and the tent poles were decorated in like manner. On

<pb>
both sides of the peacock throne was a screen on which were
figures of two angels in precious stones. The roof of the tent
consisted of seven pieces; and when it was transported to any
place, two of these pieces, packed in cotton, were put into a
wooden chest, two of which chests were a sufficient load for an
elephant. The screen filled another chest. The walls of the
tent, the tent poles, and the tent pins, which latter were of massy
gold, loaded five other elephants, so that for the carriage of the
whole were required seven elephants."
The same writer says, in another work:—" The bargah (royal
pavilion) is of such magnitude, as to be able to contain ten
thousand persons; and the erecting of it employs one thousand
serash (camp-colour-men) for a week, with the help of machines.
One of these bargahs, without any ornaments, costs upwards of
ten thousand rupees. They are sometimes finely ornamented with
tin. From the price of a plain one may be formed a comparative
estimate of what would be the expense of making other kinds."1
In a fine old engraving which I have, representing the "total
ruin" of the Turks in the great battle fought on the Danube
in 1687, are representations of several magnificent Turkish
tents, superbly ornamented, and embroidered without and
within with arabesque devices. Their richness and beauty will
be understood from the following account of an encampment
in the time of the Sultan Mahomet IV.:—" The encampment
was about four miles from Constantinople. The tents were
about two hundred in number, ranged without order, only the
grand seignieur's seemed to be in the midst and to overtop all
the rest, and well worthy of observation, costing, as was reported,
180,000 dollars, richly embroidered on the inside with gold, and
supported by pillars plated with gold. Within the walls of this
pavilion were numerous offices belonging to the seraglio. There
were retirements and apartments for the pages, chiosks and
places of pleasure, and although I could not get admittance to
view the innermost chambers, yet by the outer and more
common places of resort, I could make a guess at the richness
1 "Ayeen Akbery; or the Institutes of the Emperor Akber." Translated from the
original Persian by Francis Gladwin. London, 1800; vol. i. p. 61.
<pb>
and greatness of the rest; being sumptuous beyond comparison
of any in use among Christian princes.
"On the right hand was pitched the Grand Vizier's tent,
exceedingly rich and lofty, and had I not seen that of the
Sultan before, I should have judged it the best that my eyes
had seen, the ostentation and magnificence of this Empire being
evidenced in nothing more than in the richness of their
pavilions, sumptuous beyond the fixed palaces of princes erected
with marble and mortar."1
Indeed, in reading these accounts, we can more readily believe
them all, to be descriptive of the ceremonial customs of Eastern
princes, whose magnificence is the never-ending theme of
Arabian story-tellers, than that they can refer to the habita-
tions in the field of those iron-handed warriors, whose hardy
prowess and restless love of adventure maintained in Europe, for
several centuries, a state of perpetual war.
I have already alluded to the love of display which was
almost universal during the middle ages, but this love was
scarcely gratified by exhibitions of wealth alone. Solemnities
and ceremonials were appreciated very much, as they were ad-
dressed to the sensuous tastes which pre-eminently characterized
those times. I very much question if there was ever a time
when brilliant colours have been more admired. The common
costumes of the nobles were in scarlet, and blue, and green, and
purple.2 The houses' of the rich were adorned with the most
superb draperies; while on all days of public rejoicing, the exhi-
bition, at the windows, of silks, cloths of gold and silver, and
the richest tapestries, was equally held as an indication of respect
for the day, and of personal consideration.3
The sails of ships were often of scarlet or purple, or satin dyed
in grain.4 Even the architecture of this period was strongly

marked by the same taste, which built of mosaic Giotto's tower
and the noble duomo beside it, and flooded the interior of the
cathedrals with those splendid colours derived from arts which are
to-day almost lost. But perhaps in mediaeval encampments, more
than anywhere else, were to be found the very richest effects obtain-
able by varieties in colour, shade and tint. The tents differed from
each other in form, but more especially in colour; one was red,
another purple, another blue, another white; while in others
was used a variety of brilliant tints, which, with the brightness
of the numerous ornaments, the richness of the tissues employed,
and the elegance of the
forms given to the pavil-
ions, often resulted in the
creation of the most bril-
liant and even imposing
spectacles.
In Fig. 11, is a repre-
sentation of a tent which
I have had copied from
an illuminated manu-
script of Froissart, in the
Bibliotheque Imperiale
(No. 2,643).
It represents the tent of a French knight or baron of the four-
teenth century. In form, it may resemble the papilio of a Roman
officer; but it would be quite impossible for me to give an idea
of the richness of its colours. It was probably made of silk;
the walls are purple; the scalloped border running around the
line of junction between the walls and roof is red, and richly
trimmed with gold; the roof is of purple silk or damask; the
spiral band on the roof is in gold, and contains perhaps some

inscription; the cords and stay ropes are of finely twisted gold,
while an ornamented lance-head, bearing an emblazoned pennon,
surmounts the whole. Tents quite like this may be found in
English manuscripts of the time, two or three of which have been
copied by Strutt.
In Fig. 12 may be seen another tent, which I have had copied
also from the same manuscript of Froissart.1 Although perhaps
more graceful, it has a certain resemblance in its form to our

modern tents, but the resemblance is one of form only. The
stuffs of which it was made must have been exceedingly costly—
of silk or damask of a rich crimson colour; the cords were pro-
bably of the finest linen, and the trimmings of gold and silver; the
two standards terminated in elaborately carved and gilded lance
points; while the monogram of the occupant was emblazoned, in
letters of gold, on one of the walls.
One certainly may not be a little surprised to learn that tents

were so beautifully made, so many hundred years ago; and the
surprise is, perhaps, even greater after one has examined the
splendid representations of these tents, with which the old
copyists sometimes embellished their manuscripts.1 But the
means for gratifying the general love for displays of material
magnificence existed, during the middle ages, in a much larger
degree than has generally been supposed. To speak only of the
industry most essential to tent-making: the art of weaving was
intelligently and extensively practised in western Europe during
the thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries.
Even long before, coarse fabrics of wool and linen were in
common use, and by no means expensive ; of such stuffs the sails
of ships and tents were generally made. But, shortly after the
time of the First Crusade, an extensive commerce had been
opened with Constantinople, Alexandria, and the markets of the
East, and silk, velvet, cloth of gold, taffeta, damask, and a great
variety of costly stuffs, were distributed throughout Europe,
where very soon the fabrication of these tissues was commenced.
Manufactories were established, first in Italy and Spain, and
afterwards in France and Flanders. So early as the thirteenth
century, in Spain, and in the single district of Jaen, there were
three thousand villages occupied with the raising of silkworms;
while, in the Moorish city of Seville alone, there were six
thousand looms engaged in weaving silks.2 Indeed, during
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, these industries, which
scarcely contributed to any end, other than the gratification of
individual habits of luxury and the popular taste for display,
had attained a development almost incredible. Says a Vene-
tian writer of the time:—"Within a period of fifty years, the in-
dustry of weaving has so much increased, that the Govern-
ment of Venice draws from it an annual revenue of 500,000
crowns, Reggio, a revenue of 10,000,000 of crowns, and Sicily
a still greater one; for, to say the whole in one word, this art
1 In the collections of MM. Jubinal and Du Sommerard are a great variety of
sketches of mediaeval tents taken from tapestries. Such tents are also not un-
frequently to be found represented on old pieces of faience.

<pb>
is now the very nerve of trade, and silk cloths are made which
were quite unknown to the ancients."1 And Thomas Mocenigo,
when Doge of Venice, is represented as having said to the
Senate:—" The Lombards buy of us every year, of cloth of
gold and silk, to the amount of 250,000 ducats; and bear in
mind, that every year also, Verona takes two hundred pieces
of cloth of gold, silver and silk, Vicenza, one hundred and
twenty, Padua, two hundred, Trevisa, one hundred and twenty,
and Frioul fifty."2
The influence of those displays, special to encampments and
tent-life during the middle ages, are still curiously evident in
certain existing customs. Every pavilion bore one or more
gaily-coloured pennons, or was surmounted by a gilded figure of
an animal or a bird, or by some emblematic device.8 As it was
often convenient to use symbols of rank, these tent ornaments
were frequently selected for the purpose. Thus the flag taken
from the tent was entitled to so much of the consideration which
belonged to a pavilion, as to finally receive that name—a name
which, as applied to a flag, has through the shifts of time become
much more familiar to our sailors than to our soldiers/ So

* Littre says, that as the word pavilion was not only applied to tents, but to cloths
used for awnings (tentures), the word began to be used to signify a standard. I
see, however, no very natural connection between awnings and flags. A much
<pb>
many of the animals, once used only as terminal ornaments for
the tent standards, have been preserved in the coats of arms
'which the heralds subsequently invented. The Dukes of Brittany
are said to have placed upon their tents a red cap lined with
ermine, as a token of their love of independence and liberty—a
token which has certainly lost none of its ancient significance.
Perhaps one of the most curious vestiges still existing of
that sovereignty, once represented in the field by pavilions
of silk and gold, may be seen in the armorial emblems of
certain families, which are placed under a drapery, the curtains
of which fall by the sides of the insignia. These curtains repre-
sent the open doorway of a pavilion, and are alike the symbols of
princely rank and military strength.1 The arms of France, and
of several other states, are thus placed, and may be seen by any
one, on the reverse of certain gold and silver coins.
So the dais, and the lit de justice, beneath which kings are
represented as sitting in the presence of their parliaments, are
to be considered not so much ornaments of the throne, as the
emblems of the ancient custom of sovereigns to meet their
people, and administer justice, at the doorways of their
pavilions.
 
UT perhaps I have already occupied your attention too
long with subjects which, whatever may be their his-
torical interest, throw little light upon tent architecture
in its more practical relations to military life. It is tolerably
certain, however, that few if any changes were made in Europe
in the methods of encamping active armies, already described,
better suggestion has been made—that pavilion, a flag, is not derived from the same
root as pavilion, a tent. The custom of carrying a flag at a point is said to have
been a Moorish one; and the name pavilion, given to a flag, is said to have originated
from this custom, and to have been derived from the Spanish word pabellon, an
augment of paves, whenco the French words pavois, pavoiser, &c. If, however,
they both take their origin from the root papilio, a flag was called & pavilion, most
probably by a simple metonymy, the occasion for which I have stated.

before the middle of the seventeenth century. Ambroise Pare' has
given us a facetious but graphic picture of the imperial encamp-
ment before Metz, in 1552. The whole German army was there
lodged in holes in the ground, which were only covered over with
a little straw:—" Nevertheless," as the snow lay on the ground
two feet deep, "every soldier had his camp-bed strown with glitter-
ing and brilliant stars, more sparkling than had they been of fine
gold. And every day they had white sheets where they lodged
—at the sign of the Moon. They had no need of combs to get
the down and feathers out of their hair and beards, and always
had white napkins at hand,"1 &c.
In the edition of Fronsperger, published at Frankfort in 1566,
there are a number of engravings representing scenes common
in German camps at that time, and among others, there is a
large eau-forte by Joste Ammon, which exhibits the disposition
of a German camp. The different quarters are numbered, and
an explanation accompanies the plate; but nearly all the tents,
many of which are richly ornamented, are assigned to officers
connected with the administration of the camp. Letters, upon a
few open spaces, indicate the positions assigned to certain bodies
of troops—infantry, cavalry, and artillery. A few screens, or
rude huts of boards, bushes, and straw, are the only quarters
occupied by troops, shown in the sketch, which unquestionably
represents with fidelity the usual appearance of a German camp
in the sixteenth century.
According to certain writers, the Austrians and Hungarians
would appear not only to have made use of tents, earlier
than most of the German people, but to have been better pro-
vided with them, at the time of which I am speaking. Basta,
who wrote towards the close of the sixteenth century, speaks of
the troops being generally encamped "in cabins and tents;" but
he observes that in Hungary, the cavalry was not lodged in town
as in the Netherlands, but in the field "in many pavilions."
In a plate which he gives, showing how a camp should be en-
trenched, the whole force—infantry, artillery, and cavalry—are
1 (Euvres d'Ambroise Pare, tome iii. p. 708.
<pb>
represented as having tents; those for the troops being wedge-
shaped, while those of the officers are circular pavilions with
dome-shaped roofs.1
In 1568, De la Noue regrets, that it was necessary to lodge
the troops scattered about in various places f and he is said to
have recommended a provision of tents for common soldiers.
But the soldiers still continued to be quartered in their logis,
as in Froissart's time, as may be seen by consulting De Saulx
and subsequent writers.
The Princes of Orange are said to have first put in practice
De la Noue's project, by generalizing the use of tents among the
troops of their armies. But the statement has been controverted,
and would appear to have been based upon the efforts made by
Maurice of Nassau, towards the close of the sixteenth century,
to establish some order in the arrangement of his camps. Stevin
and Solemne, in their accounts of the camps of Maurice and
Frederick, represent the troops to have been quartered in frame-
work huts covered with straw; and we may infer from them, that
the use of tents was limited to officers. The huts were small—
generally about eight feet square and eleven feet high—and were
intended for two soldiers only.3
In but one instance does Solemne mention the use of tents by
troops—at Oppenheim, in 1620:—" The regiment of militia of

3 These huts were built in the following manner:—Two poles, twelve feet long,
and forked at the top, were set up, eight feet apart, and sunk in the ground one foot.
A ridge-pole was placed in their forks. Four forked sticks, five feet high, served as
corner posts, each pair sustaining a pole which answered as a plate; a rafter also
connected each corner post with the ridge-pole. These eleven poles, which were
tied together, formed the principal part of the skeleton of the hut. The skeleton
was, however, completed and strengthened by a lattice-work of sticks—four vertical
and nine transverse, at each end, two vertical and three transverse on the sides,
while five vertical and four transverse sticks completed the roof—the whole being tied
together by cords or withes. The frame-work was now thatched with straw, which
for the most part was woven into mats and put on in sections.
<pb>
Col. Wynenbourg had tents instead of huts. These were twelve
feet wide and twenty feet high; each company of 200 men had
twenty tents; the tents were placed in a line, and ten soldiers
were put in each tent, and each soldier had with his comrade a
woman; and they had a bed four feet wide, and, above in the
middle of each tent, there was a piece of wood fitted with pegs
where the soldiers suspended their muskets most conveniently.
On these tents were written the names of the villages or the
cities to which they belonged, and the tents covered very little
ground, as compared with the huts of straw used by the other
regiments."
Solemne declares that:—"The trh-illustre Prince d'Orange,
Maurice, de tres haulte mimoire, so excellently well ordered the
lodgings of his army, that there was not an officer, great or small,
or the humblest soldier, who would not confess that he had
ample room in his quarters."1 And an examination of the mag-
nificent engravings which accompany his work—showing the
disposition of the different parts of a Dutch camp, the rich
pavilions and tents of the officers, the huts of the infantry,
cavalry, artillery, and vivandiers—will convince any one that
whatever improvements may have been introduced into the art
of castrametation, the ordering of encampments has since gained
nothing in mere geometrical regularity.
Indeed, it is very certain that camps were nearly everywhere
in Europe regularly laid out, some time before the use of tents
became general. Thus De la Fontaine and M. de Gayaa give
rules for the establishment of camps quite similar to those even

now in use; but the only tents they mention are those of officers,
and in fact, they both expressly state that the troops were to be
quartered in barracks and huts;1 while Le Blonde gives it as his
opinion, that the troop-tent became well known to the French
service, not before the treaty of Riswick, in 1697.2
Towards the close of the seventeenth century, after the great
defeat of the Turks before Vienna, the imperial armies appear to
have been generally well supplied with tents. Di Marsigli says,
the troops of the Emperor Leopold were abundantly provided
with tents, immense numbers having been taken from the Turks;
but that the Turkish tents, made of cotton and lined, were
thought to be too heavy; and that for this reason tents were made
of German canvas (linen), which was much lighter, as also that
these tents were made smaller, and more portable. And he also
says, the German officers used tents which they called marquees,
and that they improved them by adding curtains, which falling
perpendicularly to the ground, formed a sort of gallery between
the sides of the tent, which served as an equal protection against
the heat and the cold; and that the Turks finally imitated them
in this.
Still, Di Marsigli thinks, the most important military informa-
tion communicated by the Turks, was that which concerned the
manner of using tents.3
The common Turkish army tent of that time—the tent gene-
rally used by the Janissaries—was conical in form, and sup-
ported by a single mast. The covering was drawn out by cord-
age attached about two-thirds of the way up its sides. "In the
Levant," says the "EncyclopeMie," "tents were made of heavy
cloth (canvas) firmly woven, which sheds water easily. The covering
was supported by a single mast, and was fastened down, around
its border, by cords hooked over iron pins driven into the ground.
At two-thirds the height of the pavilion, were attached cords
which were stayed out straightly, by means of other pins set far-
ther from the mast than the first; the cords pull out the top of

<pb>
the pavilion, giving to it a sharp angle, like that of a mansard
roof." 1 This description, intended doubtless to represent the
old Turkish conical tent, is correct except in the last statement,
which is likely to mislead.2 The walls of this tent did not fall
perpendicularly from the line of the insertion of the cords, but
were fastened to the ground, quite close to the outer row of
pins; the cords, when pulled out, did not give therefore to the
top of the pavilion a sharp angle. In its outlines, this tent re-
presented a cone—or more exactly, it represented a cone sur-
mounted by the apex of a second cone, having a slightly larger
base. These tents were always lined on the inside with some
sort of cloth—generally of cotton; at least, the upper part or
dome of the tent, was lined.
The marquee appears at this time to have been used rather by
officers than by common soldiers. The marquee was a house-shaped
tent, covered by a second or upper roof; it was sometimes used
without the second roof, still retaining its name. A peculiarity of
the second or outer covering was, that it only covered the roof
of the marquee, projecting a little over the ends and sides of the
tent. The roof and even the sides of the marquee were lined.
The tents of this kind, which belonged to the principal officers,
were always very handsomely carpeted. These officers also, in ad-
dition to their marquees, often made use of a sort of square tent,
closed on three sides and overhead, but entirely open in front.
The Turks were also in the habit of establishing their latrines be-
hind canvas screens, which invariably formed a part of their camp-
ing material. In fact, however primitive an idea this people may
have had, at the close of the seventeenth century, of castrameta-
tion as an art, their camping material left very little to be desired
either as regards its abundance or its quality; and its excellence
1 "Encyclopedie," art. " Tente."
2 Bardin, after having quoted the statement of the " Encyclopedie," immediately
observes:—"Ces pavilions ont pu etre,on le voit, le modele de nos marquises." Nowthe
tent described in the "Encyclopedie" resembled a marquee in no respect more than
does a modern French tente conique. The similitude of the mansard roof misled.
Another cause of misconception may also possibly have existed in the word pavilion,
which has recently been chiefly applied to house-shaped constructions; formerly
the pavilion was usually a round or conical tent.
<pb>
was undoubtedly one of the causes of the very general disposi-
tion, shown at that time throughout Europe, to place armies in
the field under the shelter of tents. Still, the credit of having
created and fashioned the camping material of Europe can
scarcely be accorded to the Turks. For centuries the Turks had
only repeated the knowledge which they had acquired from the
Tartars, the Arabs, and the various Oriental races with which
for a long time they were closely allied and assimilated. In the
East, one may still see tents constructed of nearly every kind of
material, and of almost every conceivable form; and there is
scarcely any reason to doubt that the types most frequently
seen to-day, were those employed hundreds, even thousands of
years ago, as also, that they have served as models as well in
the construction of the splendid pavilions of the Crusaders and
the knights of the middle ages, as of many of the less imposing
and more serviceable tents, under which European armies have
encamped in more recent times.
The "Encyclopedic" and De Chesnel give to Louis XIV. the
credit of having first issued tents to the troops of modern
armies; but there is no evidence that tents were furnished by
the French Government during the long reign of that king,
except to la maison militaire du roi, and to certain corps pri-
vilegies ;l and although Turenne and Montecuculi speak of tents
in their "Memoires"2 as if they formed a part of a military outfit
during the Franco-German wars which took place in the reign of
Louis XIV., there existed in the French service, until as late as
1 Thus, an expeditionary force, sent to the aid of Candia in 1669, numbering
about 6000 men, is said to have taken with it "more than fourteen hundred
tents." (" Histoire de Louvois," par Camille Rousset, tome i. p. 258.) But the
common method of establishing an encampment at this time, is better shown in the
following statement, which appears in a communication of Camus Destouches to
Louvois, cited in the work referred to:—" The soldiers are lodged at Charleroi in
the most pitiable manner. Sixteen soldiers are placed with four beds in a little hut
made of straw, which it is impossible to keep warm, without great danger of setting
it on fire, and as the floor is always covered with mud, and there can be but littlo fire,
the soldier is constantly suffering from humidity."

1732, very little uniformity as regards either the form and qualities
of the tents employed, or the number allowed to a company. I
am quite aware that De Bombelles, who wrote towards the close
of the reign of Louis XIV., speaks as if the soldiers had tents,
and as if these tents had a fixed size and form—that is, he says
they were two paces wide, and that each company was presumed
to have eleven.1 But, inasmuch as the officers still bought their
own tents, and the regiments provided themselves with shelter
as best they could, it is probable that De Bombelles' account
applied rather to a theoretical or model camp, than to one occu-
pied by an active army at the time he wrote. In some of Van
der Meulen's battle pictures, may be seen representations of
the camps and tents of the time of Louis XIV., which are un-
questionably historically accurate. The camps were evidently
laid out with very little order, and the tents represented are of
nearly every imaginable kind. One may see, side by side, the
splendid pavilions of the noblesse, the tents of the officers—
square, round, conical, wedge-shaped—the make-shift tents of
the men—strips of canvas, or blankets stretched over poles, or
attached to the sides of waggons, to secure a better shelter from
the wind beneath them—and an endless variety of booths and
bowers.
Previously to the eighteenth century, the troops in English
armies were commonly quartered by billet, or were encamped in
"baraques and hutts."2 I have already described, with sufficient
detail, the quarters furnished these troops while actively employed,
during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. In the time of
Henry VIII., while the tents and pavilions of the king and his
courtiers were, as we have seen, magnificent "beyond descrip-
tion," soldiers would appear to have been generally quartered in
1 "Memoires sur le Service Joumalier de l'lnfanterie," par M. de Bombelles.

2 Grose says the troops "were indiscriminately quartered upon all house-
holders, as was practised in England so late as the rebellion in the year 1745."
("Military Antiquities," vol. i. p. 339.) Towards the close of the eighteenth
century, Hamilton states that "the billets in England, and I may add in Scotland,
are always in public houses." (" The Duties of a Regimental Surgeon," vol. i,
p. 12.)'
<pb>
huts.1 There is a manuscript of the time of Elizabeth, in the
Harleian collection (No. 7,364), and referred to by Grose, in
which the statement is made that:—" In a companie of 100, the
souldiers are lodged in two rowes of cabbans, with a street of
1 Strutt has a plate, in which there are representations of a considerable number
of common tents of the time of Henry VIII. Among these may be seen several
tent-barracks—quadrilateral constructions with flat sloping roofs of boards, or of
boards covered with canvas, and with canvas side curtains.
A paper has been preserved, showing the composition of the household of King
Henry VIII., and how it was lodged at the time he engaged in a war with France
in 1545. It is entitled " Hales (i.e. tents), round houses with creasents and their
apparell with wagens furnyshed for the carriage of theym delivered at the Kings
Ma15 Commandement by thaudes of Anthony Aucher Lievetenante appoynted fromo

And according to it, the three officers of the stables, " for the use of the stables
had 14 hales, 5 round houses, 5 creasents and 2 wagens. Twenty hatchments of
the Kings Arms.

. . . and we are told that the tent-makers received as wages sixpence per day.
When the King (Henry VIII.) went to Hampton Court two years later, it is
recorded that his Master of the Revels "had to convey to attend the king a large
house made of forse, with timber and boards, tents, halls, pavilions, and timber
houses." The windows of these houses were made of horn, " and 2168 pounds of
wax at 6d. was spent in searing 1647 yards of new vytrye canvas for the covering
of the timber houses and the banketing houses." (See " Archseologia," published by
the Society of Antiquaries of London, vol. xviii. p. 313.)
I may further note, as evidence that tents and pavilions were used at this
period in England, rather by kings and their attendants than by the common
soldiery, that in Rymer's "Foedera," under the date of 1415, is a Royal Commis-
sion, De operariU capiendis pro pavilionibus et tentoriis Regis, and which begins as
follows:—" Rex dilecto sibi Johanni Covyn Pavilionario nostra salutem." In the
Rolls of Parliament (1485—Henry VII.) Richard Walshe is mentioned as the "Ser-
geaunt of the Kings tents." At a later time the Pavilionarius seems to have been
better known as the " Master of the Revels."
<pb>
eight foote running betweene; which row of cabbans containe
each of them five and twenty cabbans of eight foote square," &c.
But in a manuscript in the same collection, dated almost a
hundred years later,1 I find quite the same rule for the encamp-
ment of the troops:—" To a companye of foote of 100 must be
allowed 2 rowes of huttes or cabbans, each file or row 200 feet
deep & ye breadth thereof 8 feet with a street of 8 feet broad
betwixt the two files, into ye which ye doors of bothe y" rowes
of huttes must open, each door opposite one against ye other." 2
This manuscript throws much light upon the character of Eng-
lish encampments of the time. The general's tent, and the
character and disposition of the constructions around it, are quite
similar to those shown in Solemne. The tent is formed of four
pavilions, placed at the extremities of a cross of canvas covered
passage-ways. A sketch of the general's head-quarters, which
accompanies the manuscript, is described as follows :—" Ye
figure A denoteth y* Generals owne tentes for his privacye,
ye others next to it are his dinning room, his chamber of
audience and ye common hall. All ye other lesser quad-
rangles which stand about his pavilions betwixt ye letters C
and B, are ye several officers belonging to ye court, vid: ye
Secretaryes tent, y* Stewards tent, ye Gentlemans tent, ye
common hall for ye serving men, ye Kitching, ye Butterye, and
so forth. C denotes a row of huttes in which are lodged ye
under officers and servants of ye court."
Indeed, there are reasons for believing that the proportion of

circumstantial parts thereof, digested into seven sections, by W. T., in the year of
our Redemption, 1649."
s Orrery says, the soldiers' huts were eight feet broad and seven feet long, and that
each hut accommodated three soldiers; but towards the close of the seventeenth cen-
tury, the size of the huts would appear to have been reduced. According to Sir James
Turner (who, however, calls it "the old way ") there should be fifty huts in each
row, " 8 foot for the breadth " and but 3-J. feet in length. Each of these huts was
to be occupied by one soldier. And he adds:—" In the Low Country wars, the Prince
of Orange allowed four foot for the length of every foot-soldier's hut; but the
Germans, for most part, allow but 3i, whom, in this point, I have followed in this

tents used in encampments at a very early period of English
history may have been even greater than it was several centuries
subsequently. Lord Orrery evidently regarded the hutting of
troops as in his time—the latter part of the seventeenth century—
a comparatively modern invention. "In ancient times," says he,
"they used tents, instead of huts, for then the way of making
war was in the field, and armies were daily in motion, and in
such cases, straw, rushes and flags to cover, and wood to make
stakes and roofs, were not alwayes at hand, nor to form the roof
easie, but now that for the most part war is made in the besieg-
ing of strong places, or in standing camps, both officers and
soldiers use to hut, which is more warm and lasting than
tents."1 But if huts were extensively used in Lord Orrery's
time, tents had then by no means been abandoned. Says
Evelyn, in his "Diary," under the date of June 20th, 1686:—"An
extraordinary season of violent and sudden rain. The camp
still in tents." And in the same month of the following year we
find this entry:—" The camp was now again pitched at Houns-
low, the commanders profusely vying in the expense and mag-
nificence of tents."2 This statement is interesting, as it shows
that costly tents were still objects of admiration among English
officers as late as the close of the seventeenth century, and
moreover implies that tents were personal property, a fact
which would inevitably lead to ostentatious displays on the part
of the wealthy, and a reliance for shelter and cover upon every
possible makeshift on the part of the heedless and poor. From
such books and documents as are now accessible to me, I am
unable to find that troop-tents were considered as essential to
the outfit of an English army much before the middle of the
eighteenth century. Several forms of army tent were then in
general use, sketches of which are given by Grose in his
"Antiquities," and to which I shall soon have occasion to refer
more particularly.
Bardin says that the Prussian army was first regularly pro-

and written by the Right Honourable Roger Earl of Orrery." 1677; p. 86.

<pb>
vided with soldiers' tents, and that it was in imitation of this
provision, that tents were given to the French infantry. This
statement is probably correct, at least M. de Gisor informs us
that in the Prussian service, in the latter part of the seventeenth
century, each company of infantry had two tents for the
subaltern officers, and twenty-two for the soldiers. Each tent
was intended to shelter five men; and a regulation also pro-
vided that each tent should have in it two blankets, "His Majesty
wishing to preserve the health of his soldiers."1
If one may judge of the form of these tents, from representa-
tions in a ground-plan of a camp (Plate VIII.) in M. de Gisor's
book, they were the prototypes of a tent, very frequently men-
tioned, after it became a practice to place troops in regularly con-
structed camps, and which was extensively used in the French
army during the eighteenth century. This tent, known as the
"Cannoniere," was wedge-shaped, and was supported by two up-
right poles and a cross-piece; it was about six feet six inches high,
six feet eight inches wide at the base, and six feet six inches long.
It had, however, what was termed a cul-de-lampe, that is, the rear
wall was so formed that it could be stretched out at the bottom of
the tent in a semi-circular manner, some three feet and four inches
beyond the second standard, thus adding to the interior of the tent
a considerable space of a hemi-conical form. The canvas was
stretched out from the ridge-pole on each side, and pinned to the
ground, through rings, served with cord, in the lower borders of
the canvas. The front of the tent was vertical, and triangular in
form; a perpendicular opening, from the apex to the base, formed
the door-way. It will be seen that this tent was simply a
wedge tent, enlarged by bulging out one end. (See Fig. 13.)
It took nine and one half French ells of cloth (" toile d'Alencon,")
one ell (1£ yards) wide, to make a cannoniere. The cannoniere
was intended for seven soldiers, and covered about fifty square
feet of ground surface, thus allowing to each soldier but seven
square feet. This small cannoniere was, if an opinion may be
expressed from an examination of the plans of encampments in

<pb>
the works of Puysegur, Le Blond, and other military writers,
the model troop-tent in the French service during nearly the
whole of the eighteenth century.
But, as I have already remarked, there was evidently a good
deal of variety among the troop-tents first used, while nearly all
the descriptions which I have seen
of the tent (Fancien modele, are un-
satisfactory if not confused. They
would appear, however, to have
been wedge-shaped, and to have
been supported by two upright
poles forked at the top (fourckes), *- ^Z^i^
to hold the ridge-pole. They were
unstayed by ropes, the canvas coverings, of a single thickness,
being simply drawn out and pegged to the ground along the
lower borders.
It is certain that the cul-de-lampe was never an indispensable
feature of the common troop-tent. And although, as I have
remarked, it is not improbable that the cul-de-lampe may have
been a characteristic of some of the troop-tents first used in the
Prussian service, they certainly are very rarely represented
with this appendage in German paintings and engravings, of a
date anterior to the reign of Frederick the Great. They often-
times, from the sketches which I have examined, would seem
to have been formed of nearly square pieces of canvas stretched
over a ridge-pole, in such a way, as to leave both ends of the
tent quite open—that is, without vertical end walls; but as the
breadth of the canvas was frequently considerably greater than
the length of the ridge-pole, the ends of the tent might be
closed, when necessary, with the surplus canvas. Doubtless
cords were occasionally attached to the tops of the upright
standards and fastened to pegs driven into the ground, a few
feet from them; the free canvas at the ends, being thus
supported, would enlarge the interior of the tent, and give to
one or both of its ends a hemi-conical form. Indeed, it is very
probable that the cul-de-lampe owes its origin to this fact.
Nevertheless, the troops then occupied not unfrequently wedge
tents provided with vertical end walls, and similar to that shown
<pb>
in the sketch below (Fig. 14). Sometimes the ridges of these
tents are represented covered with double roofs, or hoods, and it
is a very interesting fact, that the hoods are often, in form and
appearance, exactly like those I have spoken of as peculiar to the
Roman tentorium, the only difference being one which leaves no
doubt as to the meaning of the horizontal line in the representa-
tion (Fig. 9)—two or three cords passing from the long line which
shows the limit of the lower border of the hood, to the same
number of pegs, planted in the ground a short distance outside
of the line of pegs which secure the lower border of the tent
itself.1 Simple wedge-tents, such as that shown in Figure 14,
are also to be found in sketches illustrating the movements of
the armies under Turenne, Conde\ and Marshal Saxe; and
Grose represents tents of this form as having been in use in the
English army in the middle of the
eighteenth century. Indeed, I may
again remark that the simplest as well
as most primitive form which can be
given to a tent, is that of an inverted

seventeenth century. ancients, and they are still extensively
employed among those people who cling most tenaciously to
their ancestral customs, as also wherever simplicity is sought,
and the object is to obtain the best results with the least trouble.
In some engravings which I have, representing certain Chinese
military operations in the years 1756 and 1758, a number of en-
campments are shown; in these, nearly all the tents are wedge-
shaped, and but for the peculiar distribution of the tents, the

also remark, that the double roof or hood, as applied to the wedge-tent, may be seen
in many French engravings of the same period. One of these I have now before
me. (Planche 10" in " L'Experience de TArchitecture Militaire," par le Sr. * * *
Paris, 1687.)
<pb>
encampments would be at once supposed to belong to European
armies.
Le Pere Amiot, in his book entitled "L'Art Militaire des
Chinois," published in 1772, says the tent used by the Chinese
"is five feet five inches high, fourteen feet long, and six feet
wide; it is wedge-shaped, and has triangular doors." To con-
tinue his description:—" The exterior covering is of coarse white
canvas; the tent has an inner lining of common blue cloth; six-
teen pieces of iron (sockets) hold together the frame-work, which
consists of two upright poles and a ridge-pole. The tent is
secured to the ground by eighty wooden pins, which are driven
through loops attached to the border of the canvas. The cost of
this tent, together with its fixtures, is 110 francs." 1
In French encampments in the time of Louis XIV. the
canvas was sometimes thrown over a long bar, one end of which
having been raised, was supported by a single fourche. Such
long, sloping wedge-tents may occasionally be seen in old
engravings; Denon has given representations of them in his
"Egypt," and they are still to be met with in the East.
Another tent, frequently mentioned by writers of the period of
which I am speaking, was the cortine, or courtine, an oblong
square tent used by officers (see Fig. 15). This tent was some-
times covered by a sur-tente or " fly." "They were," says Bardin,
"cenacles, made of ticking (coutil), covered by a second roof
fastened to the ground by pickets. If the second roof had walls,
the tent was called a 'marquise.'"2 When these "cortines,"
"pavillons," "pavillon a mansarde," used by officers, had simply
the double roof, they occasionally closely resembled the "hos-
pital" and " officer's" tents now used by the United States Go-
vernment. The following description of the officer's tents used
in the French service in the middle of the eighteenth century

2 Bardin, op. cit. art. "Pavilions." This statement is not correct. The mar-
quees of the Turks, and the tent first known as a marquee in the Austrian
army in the seventeenth century, only possessed a sur-tente, an over-roof, or fly.
The Austrians added to the fly, as Di Marsigli informs us, curtains or walls, thus
giving to the marquee its present form.
<pb>
may be of interest:—" The tents of the subaltern officers are
cannonieres, but larger than those for the soldiers. Those of the
superior officers are pavilions five, six, or eight feet square, made
of ticking; the roofs are seven or eight feet high; they have
four curtains, which are called walls. The pavilion is covered by
a second roof, which extends five or six feet beyond it, and ter-
minates in a cul-de-lampe (hemi-cone) at its rear end. Walls are
sometimes added to this second roof; the tent is then called a
marquise. The second roof is stretched out, by cordage attached
to pegs planted in the ground, as is the roof of the pavilion; the
walls are also fixed to pegs by cords. The rain passes easily
through the canvas and the ticking (coutil), of which the common
tents are made, and falls inside in fine drops; this is what is
called tamiser—to sift. The marquise prevents this, except

during a very heavy rain; moreover, it diminishes the heat, which
is frequently very great under the cannonieres." 1
Fig. 16 shows a pavilion, or cortine, with a sur-tente. Some-
times the sur-tente was furnished with walls, which nearly or
quite enveloped the tent. A tent so covered is shown in Fig.
17, which represents an English marquee as constructed in the
middle of the last century. This tent is apparently similar, in
every respect, to the marquee now used in the British army for
hospital purposes.
De Perrin considers the marquee to be the lineal descendant
and representative of the splendid pavilions, used in ancient times
and in the middle ages; indeed, he suggests that its very name
was derived from the rank of those who brought it into use. In

respect to the origin of the name,1 De Perrin may be quite right;
but I may observe that outer coverings have very rarely been
employed except as a means of more effectually protecting those

within tents from the excessive heat of the sun, and from the
rain; as also, that if the use of such coverings is very ancient,
it has been by no means strictly limited to persons of rank.
1 The origin of the word marquee—marquise—is not certain. Bardin denies that
it comes from marquis, a title, and states that a distinction was made between tents
marquees de raies—striped, and those of a single colour; that the word in ita primi-
tive form, is seen in the English marquee, and that the French soldiers have corrupted
marquee into marquise. Without pretending to state positively either how or when
this word first came into use, I believe Bardin's statement is wholly improbable.
The word marquise has since two hundred years been applied to a tent, not of a
peculiar colour, but of a peculiar and definite construction. This tent was a square
or oblong tent, which always had, or was intended to have, a second roof; and this
second roof was not a lining, but a second roof stretched above and over the roof of
a tent. If the upper roof was made a murailhs, with walls completely enclosing
the tent, the enclosed tent was originally still called a marquise. It is generally
conceded that the marquee is of Eastern origin. Now Di Marsigli gives a number
of sketches of Turkish marquees, and no tent appears to have been known in his
time as a marquee which did not have a second roof, or at least was not con-
structed with reference to the application of such a roof. This upper roof was not
provided with walls—it was a simple "fly;" and he says that a tent provided with
such an upper roof awas called in the imperial army a marchesa—marquise. He says
that such tents were used, principally by Turkish pashas and officers of rank, and it
would appear probable from his statement, that they were introduced into Christian
Europe in the seventeenth century, during the wars between the Turks and Aus-
trians. Their use among the Austrians seems also to have been limited to officers,
who, according to Di Marsigli, added the walls to the upper roof. The uncer-
tainty which has obscured the reasons why a certain tent should be called a marquise,
has very naturally given rise to conflicting opinions with regard to the part of such a
<pb>
The Byzantine Emperor Leon (a. d. 900) directs that the troops
about to engage upon an expedition "shall take with them
their cantines and their double tents, if there is occasion, of
which one part serves as a roof or sur-tente to the other." 1 The
Emperor Maurice (a.d. 590), in speaking of the tents used by
the Turks and Arabs, commends them as both handsome and
commodious; and M. Maizeroy, in noting this fact, does not
hesitate to accord to those peoples the credit of having invented
the double roof or "fly."2 "The Turks," says Di Marsigli,
"who possess great wealth, have convenience and elegance always
in view, in their encampments. Their tents are impenetrable
to rain, to the sun, and to the wind. The general officers and
subalterns, as well as the pashas, have double-roofed tents."3
So the Jewish tabernacle is represented as having been provided
with a roof of skins placed, as a protection, over the covering of
the tent.4 Indeed, it has been a common custom in the East,
tent which was, strictly speaking, the marquise. The "Dictionary of the French
Academy," and Furetiere, define a marquise—" grande toile qu'on tend par-dessus
uno tente d'armee." French lexicographers have, quite unanimously, agreed to con-
sider the sur-tente, or outer tent, as the true marquise, excepting the definition of
the Academy, or perhaps the authority of Furetiere, whose technical definitions are
not always trustworthy. Bardin takes the same view, and evidently bases his state-
ment partly upon a passage in Lachesnaie, who—probably—forgot to say that he took
it verbatim from De Perrin. Now none of these authorities are anterior to Di Mar-
sigli, who distinctly states, as will have been observed, that it is the under covering
which is called in the imperial armies the marchesa; while, as if to make this point
still more certain, he calls the sur-tente, (the over covering,) the dome. In short, a
tent was originally called a marquee or marquise, if not because, at least only when, it
had been constructed with reference to the application of an outer covering; and it
was to the tent. and not to this covering, that the name was given. Still, general usage
perhaps sanctions calling a sur-tente—the marquise, as this word is not only at the pre-
sent time applied to over coverings of tents, but is used also to indicate various awnings,
whether of canvas or other materials, projecting over steps leading into houses, &c., and
is even applied to the padded or outer door of a double door, which, en passant, I may ob-
serve, certain etymologists would have us believe received its name from the German
marc, Low Latin marca, French marque, in the sense of a boundary or limit, to wind,
rain, &c.

since a very remote time, to employ a second covering for tents.
The ordinary private's tent now used in Bengal, in the English
service, has an outer "fly" consisting of three folds of cotton
cloth, while the inner roof itself is double. The sepoy's pall con-
sists throughout of three folds of cloth.
From the descriptions which I have given of some of the tents
employed in European armies, during the eighteenth century—and
although tents were then at certain times issued to the troops as
liberally as they may have been at any time since1—it must not be
inferred, that they were ever regarded as other than expedients—
as substitutes for more desirable quarters. They were very
rarely employed during the winter months.2 Colombier,2 after
having indicated the precautions to be observed by men under
canvas, says:—"I have thus far spoken of armies encamped
during the summer, for it is only at this season that they encamp,
except when obliged to do so, since sometimes it is necessary
to remain in the field during the other three seasons, despite the
rigour of the weather, as was the case at the Zell, where several
regiments were under tents in the month of December, and in
the French and allied armies before Giessen (1760), in the months
of October and November.
"One can easily understand, that it is in these circumstances
that troops suffer the most in camp; the rain, snow, and hail
—everything tends to multiply the dangers of the situation."
And yet, curiously enough, he admits that the mortality is then
generally less, under a good administration, than when the troops
are encamped during the months of August and September.
But he goes on to say: "When the camp is no longer tenable, to
avoid the rigour of the season, it is customary to place the
troops for a month or six weeks in cantonnement before they go
into winter quarters." And here again, he observes that often
the assembly of large numbers of men in the same village leads
1 According to Bardin, when the Prussian Government first began to issue tents to
the troops, it took twenty-eight horses and sixteen teamsters to transport the one
hundred and twenty-eight tents of a single battalion.

<pb>
to dangers greater than those they would have encountered, had
they remained in camp. "Towards the middle of November
winter quarters are assigned the troops." These, however,
differed in no way from the cantonnement just mentioned,
except in the establishment of a few defensible posts, which,
with the presumed inactivity of the enemy, permitted perhaps a
larger dispersion of the troops among the neighbouring villages.
But sometimes it was necessary to remain in a fixed camp for
the winter, and then "barracks were ordered, or at least per-
mitted." This arrangement, by which the troops were sheltered
from the cold and the vicissitudes of the weather, "consists in
building up of branches, earth, straw, or dung, a sort of hedge
around the tent; while excavations are made (outside of the tent)
for the kitchen, and that the soldiers may warm themselves.
Although these barracks protect one very little against humidity,
they at least serve to keep off the wind. Sometimes a roof is
put over the tent. When it is solid, and sheds water well, it is
an advantage, as it is a greater protection against the cold, and
rain; but as the soldiers are allowed to make excavations, I
should prefer to let them remain in these, during the day, and
make them sleep in their tents, barricaded as I have described."
These dispositions, narrated by Colombier, were those generally
employed in camps during the reigns of Louis XIV., Louis XV.,
and Louis XVI.1 But shortly after the commencement of the
wars of the Revolution, the use of tents in the French service
was almost wholly abandoned. Hoche assured his troops that it
was "more soldier-like, more republican, and more glorious," to
take the field without tents than with them. During the great
wars of the Empire, the difficulty of obtaining cloth, and the

<pb>
difficulty of transporting shelter, for the immense armies which
were then created, resulted so far in the disuse of tents, that
although they are constantly referred to in the Ordinances of
the period, as constituting an essential part of the army equipage,
as a matter of fact, even the generals themselves were rarely pro-
vided with them. Nevertheless, the consequences of bivouacking
were fearfully disastrous. General Rogniat declared it to be " one
of the principal causes of that frightful consumption of men during
the last wars ;" 1 and Biron affirmed that "this mischievous
manner of carrying on war, caused more soldiers to perish than
the fire of the enemy."2 A partial remedy for these evils was
found, in permitting the soldiers in stationary camps to construct
huts; but it was so late as 1793, before a French army was fairly
quartered in huts. The most celebrated camp of this kind was
that at Boulogne (1803-1805). Here an army of 160,000 men
had been encamped, at first au bivouac; but the soldiers, taking
the initiative, began to build huts for themselves, until finally
the whole army was thus provided. This camp was subsequently
embellished with gardens, arbours, columns in stucco, &c.,
until, in the language of an historian :—" The austerity which
should reign in a camp was united with the elegance which is the
ornament of cities." 8
Under the Restoration, stationary camps were generally
established in huts.4 Indeed, it was only so recently as 1830, at
the time of the Algerian War, and after years of peace had
enlarged the resources' of France, and the army had been re-
organized, that tents began to be regularly and systematically
issued to the troops.
In the English army, after the use of tents had once been
adopted, it would appear to have been adhered to much more
uniformly, than has been common in Continental armies; and on
more than one occasion during the wars of the Empire, their

number is said to have offered an unpleasant sight to the com-
paratively badly quartered French troops. During the last
great war in which the English have been engaged, that of the
Crimea, as has frequently been the practice in sieges prolonged
into the winter, the troops were for the most part placed in
huts.
During the first year of the American War of the Rebellion,
the Federal troops were furnished with tents most liberally; but
as the war continued, the company tents were replaced by tentes
cFabri, and to such an extent, that long before the close of the
war, the troops were rarely provided with any other shelter.
Probably the most remarkable instance of an abandonment of
troop-tents during a campaign, in modern times, occurred in the
late Franco-German War, and on the part of the allied German
armies. Very few of these, on entering upon the campaign, were
provided with troop-tents of any sort. During the months of
July, August and September, their quarters were generally an
bivouac; and as the season grew later, the troops were quartered
in the houses of the country, or, if in tents, in those captured
from the French.
In speaking of the interior arrangement of Roman tents, I ob-
served, that beyond covering the ground with straw, nothing was
commonly done to make them habitable. The practice of thus
furnishing the interior of military tents, has almost universally
prevailed down to the present time. Where straw could not be
procured, dry grass, leaves, herbs, and the fine branches of trees
have been used as bedding.1 In cold countries, and where tents
are employed by the whole population, the occupants of tents
have very generally made their beds of skins.' The Persians,
Arabs and Turks are perhaps the only races who have in their

twisted into ropes; two rows of tent pegs are driven into the ground parallel to one
another and two feet apart, and the ropes passed around the pegs to form the web.
Other straw ropes are interlaced so as to form the woof, and an excellent mat is made
in a short time. Each man should have two mats, one for his head and shoulders,
the other for his legs."—Regulations and Instructions for Encampments, War Office,

<pb>
tents systematically used carpets or floor-cloths, as a matter of
health and convenience.
The fear of dampness, from a direct contact with the earth, has
been the occasion of many devices and suggestions. In the
United States during the War of the Rebellion, whenever the
size of the tent permitted, bunks were built, often one above the
other, as in the cabin of a ship, and this practice has occasionally
been employed elsewhere; but as a rule, in military life it has
been necessary for the soldier to sleep upon the ground, with or
without the intervening straw. The risks of such a practice are
considerable at every season of the year. That they might be
partially avoided, M. Jourdan Le Cointe was induced, many years
ago, to propose the use of a square piece of oilcloth which was to
form an accessory part of each tent, and which was to be laid on the
ground before the straw was brought into the tent; and it is a
matter worthy of note, that among the many advantages he enume-
rates which might be derived from the use of such a cloth, is this,
—those serving as scouts and at outposts "could lie down on the
naked earth wrapped up in their cloaks without having to fear
the dangers of dampness."1 The proposition of Le Cointe was
not adopted. Quite recently, however, the English Government
has so far recognized the wisdom of the suggestion, as to provide
the hospital marquee with such a floor-cloth. Soon after the
outbreak of the civil war in the United States, the Federal
soldiers were provided with an india-rubber poncho which, among
its many uses, served excellently as a floor-cloth within a tent,
or as a blanket, upon which the scout could lie down on the
ground, in the open air, without the fear of dampness.
As may be supposed, it is only after the middle of the eighteenth
century that any criticisms are to be found, concerning the quali-
ties of tents used in encampments. Colombier, who was one
of the most intelligent sanitarians of his time, has, however,
pointed out certain defects in the cannonihre, which perhaps
will be found none the less interesting, because applicable to
some of the tents still in use. As has already been observed,
tents were never considered in the eighteenth century as suitable

<pb>
quarters for troops, except during the milder portions of the
year.1 Hence Colombier says:—" Except towards autumn, when
the nights and mornings are sometimes cool, the soldier under
the cannoniere suffers much less from the cold than from the heat.
He can protect himself from the cold by packing the earth around
the border of his tent, or by pinning the border down more
tightly, or by stopping up the holes with straw; but it is more
difficult to find a remedy for the heat. The sun beats through
the canvas, and becomes sometimes almost insupportable. The
cavalryman has a remedy for this, as he can spread his cloak
over the cannonikre; the foot-soldier can only make use of leaves.
If he had only some blankets given him, he might at times use
these as the cavalryman does his cloak.
"I would have the cannonihre so made that it could be opened
at both ends, in such a way, that when it became hot, the end
towards the sun might be closed and the other opened. In this
way we might always get a current of air, which would diminish
the force of the heat."
Jourdan Le Cointe observes:—" The cannonihres of the soldier
are all ordinarily of a very angular form, low and narrow; it is
into these strangled sacks that a number of men pile themselves
at night. The pestiferous air within them in warm weather
frequently causes them to be dangerous."2 And he repeats the
recommendation of Colombier, that the tents have an opening at
1 Says Frederick the Great:—" When the campaign is over, one begins to think
of winter quarters. . . . Winter campaigns destroy troops, as well on account of the
diseases which they occasion, as from the difficulty of obtaining sufficient supplies.
... It is certain that the best army in the world could not long endure such cam-
paigns; hence war in the winter should be avoided as of all military expeditions
the most objectionable." And yet, he observes, it is sometimes necessary, and, "I
think I have made more winter campaigns than any other general of this century."
And in conducting such wars, he recommends that the troops should be kept in
cantonnements, as much as possible, and when the decisive moment arrives to march
against the enemy, that they should camp & la belle itoile, each company passing the
night around a large fire. "But as such fatigues are too violent to be long resisted,
you will use in such enterprises the greatest possible despatch." (" Instruction
Militaire du Roi de Prusse," traduite en francais par M. Feesch. Amsterdam,
1760; arts, xxvii.-xxviii.)

each end, since "tents which only open at one end, are always
infected by suffocating odours or vapours, which cause the men to
suffer cruelly during the night," and even "to mutually poison
each other when they are crowded together, as in an ant-hill, in
a sack, every issue and entrance to which is carefully shut up."
The wishes of Colombier and Jourdan Le Cointe, were practi-
cally realized by an Instruction of the year III., which autho-
rized the tents of the nouveau modele. These tents had the form
and size of two cannonikres brought together front to front. The
doorways were on the sides, and when open, left a free passage
through the tent.
 
F in this general account which I have given of tents as
used, principally in war, from the earliest times to the
present, I have only spoken of them when used as a
shelter for those who are well, it has been for the reason that it is
only very recently, that their advantages as a means of hospita-
lizing the sick have been made a subject of serious consideration.
In another part of my Report, I have stated that the first
hospitals organized under tents, of which we had any accounts of
sanitary or scientific value, were those established in the Crimea
in 1855. While this statement is quite correct, and the hos-
pitalization of the sick under canvas may be said, very truly, to
date from the time of the Crimean War, since the first experi-
ment was then made which clearly proved the value of the
system,—still, in treating of tents and their uses historically, we
must admit that long before that time, tents had occasionally
been employed to furnish quarters for those who might have
been disabled in war; and if I have chosen to present in this
place such historical facts as, relating to this use of tents, appear
to me to be most interesting, it has been partly to avoid
digressions and detached allusions to a specific use, and partly
because I have believed they might here very naturally serve to
close the general account which I have given of the tents
formerly employed, as also, to introduce the special account
which I shall give of those now in use.
<pb>
It is very certain that among those people who have been
accustomed to dwell under temporary shelter, such shelter has
served alike for the sick and the well. So also, in armies in
ancient times, the quarters given to the troops, whatever may
have been their character, were occupied alike by the sick and
the well. After tents had been introduced into the Roman
army, each soldier considered the tent occupied by his con-
tubernium, as his home; if he was ill he retired to it, if he had
been wounded, he sought a refuge in it.1 Nor was the custom
of thus regarding the army tent peculiar to the Romans, as may
be inferred from the many instances in which the older his-
torians, both Greek and Latin, speak of the large numbers of
sick and wounded found in the tents of captured camps. Often
these accounts are quite specific, and show that the wounded
there received, were the subjects of special care and solicitude.
The learned Freinshemius, in his supplement to the life of
Alexander, by Quintus Curtius, doubtless had the proof in hand
when he said:—" He (Alexander) treated his wounded with extra-
ordinary care, he visited them from tent to tent, even the
common soldiers, and assuaged the sufferings of such by
presents, by praises, and by promises."2 And Amyntas speaks
as if it was a common practice in Alexander's army to treat the
wounded in their tents.3
It is evident also from the account which Thucydides gives
of the raising of the siege of Syracuse by the Athenians, that
the sick and wounded had been very generally taken care of
during that siege in their tents.4 And, according to Livy,
during the war which the Romans carried on against the
1 "Castra sunt victori rcccptaculum, victo perfugium . . . patria altera est
militaris hsec sedes, vallumque pro moenibus, et tentorium suum euique militi
domus ac penates sunt."—Livy, lib. xliv. c. 39. See also, Livy, lib. xli. c. 4, and
Dionysius of Halicarnassus, lib. viii. c. 10, and lib. xi. e. 4; indeed, a vast number
of instances might be cited in which the camp is spoken of by writers of Roman
history, as a refuge for the sick and wounded.

<pb>
Samnites, about the year 321 B.C., Papirius Crassus, wishing
to gain the esteem of his troops, visited the wounded in their
tents.1 So Tacitus, in the account which he gives of the civil
war between Otho and Vitellius, and of the sharp conflict
between the legions Rapax and Adjutrix, says that after the
action, "in the same tents, relatives, friends, and brothers
dressed each other's wounds."2 The statement is also made
by Lampridius (a.d. 222), that Alexander Severus visited his
sick soldiers "who were in tents," and encouraged even the
humblest by his kindness:—yEgrotantes ipse visitavit per ten-
toria milites, etiam ultimos?
But it would be quite impossible to say, in view of this practice
of permitting the sick and wounded to take refuge in their tents,
that these were used as a means of hospitalizing the sick. It
was only long after the establishment of the Roman Empire,
that the importance .of maintaining an infirmary or hospital, in
the army or legion, was even suggested. It has been inferred
from a passage in the treatise on Castrametation, written by
Hyginus Gromaticus in the time of Trajan, that the Romans
were then in the habit of treating their sick in camp in hospital
tents. And Hyginus certainly speaks of the place where the
valetudinarium (infirmary) should be established in the camp, at
a distance from the veterinarium and workshops:—ut valetudi-
narium quietum esse convalescentibus possit.* Masquelez, in
commenting on this passage, the substance of which I have
given, repeats the opinion of Lange, that, as none of the writers
preceding Hyginus, not even Josephus, have made mention of
the hospital, when speaking of the camp, the valetudinarium
was probably a creation of Trajan's time ;5 while Colombier says
1 "Ipse circum saucios milites inserens in tentoria caput, singulos, ut sese
haberent, rogitans," <fcc.—Livy, lib. viii. c. 36.
2 Tacitus, "Hist.," book ii. c. 45.
3 JBL Lampridius, " Alexander Severus," c. 47; and Oratian is said to have had
the same habit:—" Vidi te circumire tentoria; Satin' salve? qucerere, tractare vulnera
sauciorum." (Ausonius " De Qratiano.")

<pb>
that he was "acquainted with no (Roman) writer, after Hyginus,
who alludes to the valetudinarium"1 and therefore doubts very
much if at any time it was considered essential to a camp.
The valetudinarium, of which Hyginus speaks, was very pro-
bably only a sort of convalescent hospital intended for con-
valescentibus—those who, having been ill, had rejoined the
legion before they were able to endure all the hardships of the
camp, or for such as, suffering from trifling ailments, might have
been fairly classed with the valetudinarians.
But in view of the entire absence of the details necessary to an
appreciation of the character of the valetudinarium, and the
importance accorded to it in the Roman army, it is very doubt-
ful if it was anything more than a temporary device. The
Roman troops were probably treated, when ill, only in quarters,
which were sometimes houses and sometimes tents, but never
hospital tents.2
I have already had occasion to speak of the slight attention
paid to the sick and wounded during the middle ages. Military
hospitals were then quite unknown, and the helpless victims of
war were commonly abandoned to their fate, and the chance of
obtaining succour from the personal charity of those to whom
they might be able to appeal. As among the Romans, doubtless
the quarters of the troops, whatever they may have been, were
the habitual places of refuge for the sick and disabled, who were
permitted to remain in them, if likely to recover speedily, or
were subject to be discharged, if considered effectively hors de
combat?
1 Colombier, " PnSceptes sur la Sant^ des Gens de Guerre." Paris, 1775; p. xviii.
2 I have elsewhere stated that contubernium was a name often given to the squad
of soldiers occupying the same quarters or tent. These soldiers were called con-
tiibemalea. Now, Vegetius, when speaking of sick soldiers, has used the words
cegri contubernoles. (" De Re Militari," lib. ii. c. 10; lib. iii. c. 2.) This expression
most unequivocally conveys the idea that although cegri—sick—soldiers nevertheless
continued to be contvbernalea—occupants of the same quarters. Indeed, the
existence of military hospitals of any sort, among the Romans, yet remains to be
proved. The arguments adduced in proof are generally quite supposititious,
since they are based to a considerable extent upon the fanciful interpretations of
scholiasts.
3 According to Ambroise Pare, the Germans, on raising the siege of Met*, in 1552,
<pb>
I have found but a single instance, in the course of my own
reading, in which a hospital organization is said to have been
maintained in camp, before the close of the sixteenth century,
and curiously enough, this relates to a tent hospital.
In the " Chronicle of the Conquest of Granada," from which I
have already made several extracts, it is said that:—" In the
spring of 1484, the ancient city of Antequera again resounded
with arms. In a little while there was a chosen force of six
thousand horse and twelve thousand foot assembled inN Ante-
quera, many of them the very flower of Spanish chivalry, troops
of the established military and religious orders, and of the Holy
Brotherhood.
"Every precaution had been taken to provide this army with
all things needful for its extensive and perilous inroad.
Numerous surgeons accompanied it, who were to attend upon all
the sick and wounded without charge, being paid for their
services by the Queen. Isabella also, in her considerate
humanity, provided six spacious tents, furnished with beds, and
"left behind in their tents, pavilions, and lodges, many sick." It is evident, how-
ever, from his quaint description of the quarters of the German army, which I have
quoted on a preceding page, that very few were in tents. (Pare, op. cit., tome iii.
p. 707.)
So, in Sammonte's " Storia di Napoli," we are told that Braccio da Mantova, a
celebrated condottiere, engaged in the service of Don Alphonso, of Spain, in 1423,
having been attacked by Francesco Sforza, was seriously wounded, and that Braccio
was carried on a shield to the tent of his conqueror, who sent to his assistance the
surgeons of his troop. Braccio died. But Sammonte adds, in the same connection,
that many other wounded were treated in camp, in their tents. And so after
Wallenstein had repulsed, on the 4th of September, 1632, the assault which Gustavus
Adolphus then made upon his camp, he is said to have gone around addressing words
of consolation to the wounded soldiers, who had been carried to their tents.
(Schiller, " Geschichte des Dreissigjahrigen Krieges.")
Aubrey, in his " History of Cardinal Richelieu," says that after every engagement,
the Cardinal sent his confidants to inquire after the wounded, and to assist them by
presents of money, &c. "in their tents and huts." And Audouin, in a passage cited
on page 143 of this Report, says that during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
all nations continued to treat the wounded and sick "in tents and quarters."
It is evident, however, from the context in each case, that these statements are
to be accepted literally, only in so far as they show that the wounded, in the times
referred to, were not provided with special shelter, but were occasionally permitted
to occupy their quarters, at least temporarily.
<pb>
all things requisite for the wounded and infirm. These continued
to be used in all great expeditions throughout the war, and
were called the Queen's Hospital. The worthy father Fray
Antonio Agapida vaunts this benignant provision of the Queen
as the first introduction of a regular camp hospital in campaign-
ing service."1
This passage would certainly seem to support the truthfulness
of the proverb, that there is nothing new under the sun, at least
in so far as the mere use of tents in the hospitalization of the sick
is concerned. But admitting it not to have been one of those
"weeds of fable" with which Irving confesses this tract of
history was too much overgrown, the principal value which we
can accord to the establishment of Queen Isabella, is its right of
priority. Whatever may have been the good results obtained
by it, they bore no fruit. The experiment was nowhere repeated,
and would have faded from the memories of men, but for the
indefatigable industry of some Spanish monk, to whom no detail
was too insignificant, which might add to the glory of his country,
or the honour of its sovereigns.2
The medico-military literature of the sixteenth and seven-
teenth centuries passes over, almost in silence, the whole subject
of field hospitalization. From it one can obtain very little infor-
mation concerning even the quarters of the troops, or any of
those conditions which most directly influenced the health of the
army. That the historical and military "mimoires" of the
1 Op. cit. chap, xxvii. p. 88.
s That too much importance may not bo attributed to the passage cited in ite
bearing upon questions relating to the first use in the field of regular camp and
more especially tent hospitals; and, inasmuch as Ballinglal (" Outlines of Military
Surgery") appears to have been particularly familiar with the writings of the
"worthy Fray Antonio Agapida," I may here note: that in fact there never was a
Fray Antonio Agapida. The name of this imaginary personage was used by Irving
as a collective expression for the various sources from which he took his narrative,
including among these his own imagination. It is much more probable, however,
that the passage quoted contains facts derived from some one of the numerous
chronicles consulted by Irving, in the preparation of his "Chronicle," than that the
statement is a fiction of his own. Still, as an authority upon any historical subject,
Irving has but little weight; and his Mr. Diedrich Knickerbocker is about as good
evidence on the history of New York, as his Fray Agapida on that of Granada.
<pb>
period should have been equally silent, is scarcely surprising;
indeed, the whole subject of hospitalizing the sick of armies was
so little thought about, by the class of writers who produced
these works, as to have scarcely been made the subject of a pass-
ing remark. Sickness and death were considered the inevitable
conditions of war, and the mortality from disease, the tribute de-
manded by an inexorable fate alike from the victor and the
vanquished. Few general officers conceived that they could
possibly do more, in behalf of the sick, than discharge them
from the service, or consign them to such quarters as chance,
necessity, or an ignorant parsimony had provided.
We only learn that a few hospitals, such as they were, existed
somewhere, and that the sick were occasionally taken care of in
camp; and it is not improbable that tents may in some instances
have been especially assigned to the treatment of certain cases.
But it may be safely said, that at the close of the seventeenth
century, the care of the sick in camp was the subject of very few
fixed regulations in any army in Europe. So far as the French
service is concerned, this fact is very well shown in a passage in
Bombelles, which is as follows :—" The sergeants should never
take soldiers to the hospital on their own responsibility; they
should do this, only by the order of the surgeon-major, and by
that of their officers, who frequently prefer to have them treated
in a separate tent, at their own expense; for every soldier who
goes to the hospital runs a great risk of never coming back,
either by reason of death or desertion." 1 Thus it appears, that
at the time of which I speak, officers (company or battalion)
could have the men taken care of at their own expense, in a tent,
if it so pleased them.
Indeed, this state of things continued very generally, until the
middle or latter part of the eighteenth century. The infrequent
references made to tents by nearly all writers on medico-military
subjects until towards the close of the eighteenth century, is
certainly very remarkable. No allusion is made to them by the
author of the "Memoires concernant les Hopitaux Militaires,"
presented to the Council, July 31, 1736. The " Ordonnance du
1 Bombelles, "Memoires," tome i. p. 152.
<pb>
Roi portant reglement general concernant les Hdpitaux Mili-
taires," of the 1st of January, 1747—up to which time there had
been, as regards the hospitals, according to Bardin, nothing but
"arbitraire, desordre et dilapidation "—is silent upon the sub-
ject of tents. Chenneviere reproduces this "Ordonnance" in the
second volume of his "Details Militaires," published in 1750;
and although adding much curious information concerning the
organization of hospitals both fixed and ambulant, he refers to
the use of tents for hospital purposes, neither in this volume, nor
when he again wrote upon the organization of army hospitals, in
the 5th volume of his "Details," published eighteen years later.
The "EncyclopeMie," in the article on "Les H6pitaux Mili-
taires," which appeared in the Supplement of 1777, makes no
mention of the employment of tents. Nor does Daignan, in his
treatise on military hospitals, even allude to the existence of
tents.1
Munro is, in fact, one of the earliest medical writers who refers
to the use of tents for hospital purposes. In an " Essay" pub-
lished in London in 1769, he says:—" The sick soldier should be
sent either to the regimental or general hospital; or at least, if
these hospitals are far off, and it be impossible, from any cause, to
convey the sick to these places, they should be put under tents."
This recommendation, in his book, of the use of tents for hospital
purposes, is supported by a foot-note, which is as follows:—
"Certain surgeons-major serving in Germany always took with
them, on going into the field, a number of reserved tents, which
followed the regiment with the medicines; and whenever their
soldiers fell sick in camp, if they were not near villages where
they could establish the regimental hospital in a house, they
directed the reserved tents to be pitched, and the ground to
be covered with a plenty of straw, and with blankets, that the
sick might lie there and be taken care of, until there should
be a favourable opportunity of sending them to the general
hospital."2

tome i. Introduction, seconde partie, p. lvii.
<pb>
Although no date is given to indicate when "certain surgeons-
major" served in Germany, that very circumstance makes it pro-
bable, that a reference is made to facts connected with the
campaigns—which occurred a few years before the publication of
the Essay—between 1757 and 1762. As the Prussian army is
said to have been "regularly provided" with tents, some time
before the general employment of such shelter in the French ser-
vice, it is not unlikely that in Germany tents were first made use
of on the Continent, as a means of sheltering the sick, as also, that
the use of tents for hospital purposes in English armies, may have
been adopted from their allies, as were a multitude of still existing
English military usages, during the campaigns in Flanders and
Germany of the first part of the eighteenth century. Munro
also, in speaking of hospital ships, says:—" They ought to take
on board when receiving their provisions, a number of large
tents suitable to lodge the sick and wounded immediately on
making a landing, in those places where the troops are to remain
some time. When, however, a siege is anticipated which may
last some time, and it may not be possible to have suitable places
for the sick until the close of the siege, it is well to attach to the
fleet a vessel or two,- loaded with wood or other materials suit-
able for constructing temporary pavilions or huts for the sick, if
such materials cannot be obtained where the troops are to ope-
rate. Such pavilions or huts covered with thatch, are very
necessary in warm climates, because the rays of the sun, which
fall perpendicularly upon the canvas of the tents, render their
interior insupportably hot."1
M. Begue de Presle, in a " discourse preliminary" to the work
of Munro, to which I have referred, and of which he was the
French translator, alludes to the use of tents as follows:—" The
neighbouring villages are selected for these hospitals (hopitaux
ambulans), the farm-houses, churches, and barns serving as
wards. If these conveniences cannot be obtained, the sick are
placed under tents. If the sick are put under tents, every pre-
caution must be taken to render a sojourn there as little in-
jurious as possible. The earth should be beaten down and
1 Op. cit. Int. seconde partie, p. 82.
<pb>
sprinkled with sand; the beds should be placed upon shavings or
straw; earth should be thrown up around the edges of the tent,
which should also be surrounded by a ditch; the tent should be
covered with several pieces of canvas; perfumes should be
burned within it; a little fire should be placed in a chimney
made of turf, or at least one should be lighted outside of the
tent. There ought to be several supplementary tents, into
which might be put apart, those sick with contagious diseases.
It would be profitable, however, to establish in place of the tents
light frame-work barracks, which might be easily and quickly put
up, as also taken down."
The first instance, within my own knowledge, in which the use
of tents was recommended—without reference to the existence of
other means of shelter—in the organization of hospitals for the
sick and wounded, may be found in a work published in the year
III. of the French Republic. After the observation, that it is
customary to establish the ambulant hospitals in large buildings
—generally convents—and that these buildings are very rarely
suitable for such a purpose, these statements follow :—" The
proportion of deaths to the sick in the field hospitals is commonly
sixteen per cent. ; in the sedentary hospitals, the proportion is
three per cent. This difference in the ratio of the deaths to
the sick, depends upon the comparative facility with which pure
air may be obtained in the sedentary hospitals.
"The way to correct this vice of the hospitals which follow
armies, would be to organize them under tents—sous des tentes—
instead of establishing them in buildings. The happy results
which have recently been obtained at the camp infirmary of the
School of Mars—au camp de sauti de VEcole de Mars—should be
an inducement to multiply these establishments. By means of
such a system those successive lines of hospitals might be dis-
pensed with, as also the repeated transportation of the sick,
which employs a large number of waggons and horses; and in
fact, those epidemics which are brought from camps into the
interior of the country by convoys of the sick."
And again, in another chapter, it is observed:—" The air
must always be considered as the first agent in accomplishing
a cure, as that, without which, all other assistance must be
ineffectual. This fact should make every one feel how important
<pb>
it is to form in the rear of armies camps de santi, and to treat
the sick under tents where the air can renew itself easily and
completely." And the statement is added:—" It is only in the
winter, or in seasons especially rainy, or in special cases of
disease, that the sick should be sent to hospitals or placed in
barracks." 1
No recognition of the value of tents in the hospitalization of
the sick could be expressed more clearly than this; and the
reasons assigned for such a use are as valid and as comprehensive
as had they been founded upon the results of an extensive expe-
rience. That they were not so founded is, however, certain.
Unquestionably, towards the close of the last century, a hospital
was once organized under tents at the Ecole de Mars, and with a
"succes heureux;" but as I have found no allusion to this ex-
periment in any contemporaneous writer, and have been unable
to obtain any details concerning the installation, or in fact any
statements concerning it, except those which I have here re-
produced, I can only infer that it attracted very little attention
at the time, and that the propositions of the writer, luminous and
meritorious though they be, are to be considered historically
rather as the motives of a project than as the inductions from
practice.
A few years later, the use of tents for hospitals was recognized
by the French Government in an official decree, from which I
shall make a few extracts.2
"Should there be no place for a field hospital (hdpital siden-
taire), or should the place be unsuitable, the Commissaire can
have the sick barracked, or put under tents; he can also
have tents pitched or barracks constructed for an ambulance
(hdpital ambulant), which may seem likely to remain a consider-
able time at a fixed post." (II. Sec., Art. 2.)
In the same decree we are told how the divisions of the ambu-
lances appointed to follow the different columns of the army
were to be organized; "and in such a manner, as to form in the
1 "Programmes des Cours Ke'volutionnaires sur 1'Art Militaire," op. cit. c. viii.;
and also, chap. sup. " Sur la Sante des Troupes."
s Arrete' du-24 thermidor, an viii, (August 11, 1800.) See "Legislation Mili-
taire," tome iv. p. 4.
<pb>
field one or several hospitals of first relief, even under tents, in
the absence of buildings." (IV. Sec., Art. 27.)
Again, we find that:—" Soldiers affected with simple itch, or
gonorrhoea uncomplicated, shall be treated under tents, to wit:
in1 the armies of the South from the 21st of April until the 23rd
of September, and in the armies of the West and North from the
21st of May until the 23rd of September. In the camps, and
attached to each army corps, there shall be a certain number
of tents set apart for the treatment of the itch." (VIII. Sec.,
Arts. 75-7.)
These extracts present everything said upon the subject of
tents, in this ordinance of the French Government relating to
hospitals; and in fact, Articles 2 and 27 state, substantially,
everything which has since been said in official ordinances. .
It was very seldom, however, that the terms of the decree were
acted upon, as we may learn by consulting Larrey, Percy, Des-
gennettes, and other officiers de sanU under the First Empire.
At least, except at the Ecole de Mars, no one appears to have
discovered that a hospitalization under tents possessed any
special advantages, or was to be considered in any other light
than as a substitute for the inaccessible or unavailable shelter of
more substantial constructions.
Larrey seems to have been particularly unfortunate in his ex-
perience. "At the battle of El A'rich," he says, "the wounded
were placed under tents upon the wet earth, exposed to the con-
tinual rain which fell during the siege of this fort. Eight were
attacked with tetanus, which assumed every form, and was fol-
lowed by death in each case." Referring to this incident in
another place, he informs us that "the tents were bad," and
moreover, that numbers of the wounded were only under the
cover of palm leaves, "alike unprotected against the rain and
dampness." 1 These are the only allusions Larrey makes in his
"Memoires" to the use of tents.
Dr. Hennen, who served as an army physician during the
Peninsular campaign of 1812, says :—" Marquees are excellent
1 Larrey, " Memoires," Paris, 1812; tome i. pp. 244, 281.
<pb>
as hospitals in good weather." 1 But I can only conclude, after
having consulted the writings of Guthrie, Faulkner, Millingen,
and other English surgeons, that during the early part of this
century, tents were rarely used even in the British service—
except perhaps for the regimental infirmary—at any season of
the year, when other shelter could be procured. Indeed, until
the time of the Crimean War, they were employed in no
European army as a means of hospitalizing the sick, except occa-
sionally and in very limited numbers.
The description which I am about to give of the tents now in
use in the armies of some of the principal military states, will
show with sufficient clearness the character of the shelter which
has been provided for the sick and wounded of modern armies,
when it has been thought expedient to place them in hospitals
under canvas; and that my account may be in this respect as
complete as possible, I shall indicate the qualities of each tent
model with special reference to what I believe to be one of the
most important and useful services, which may be secured by the
employment of portable shelter in the field.
 
H^&^lEFORE attempting, however, to describe in detail the
^Ijgjll tents of the present century, those now used in the con-
struction of camps, and more especially of hospitals, it
may not be improper to present, in a general way, the essential
facts derived from an historical study of tent architecture.
The greatest differences in the construction of tents, have been
occasioned by the more or less abundance of the materials from
which a temporary shelter could easily be made. Thus, where the
common arts of life are unknown, grass, the bark and branches
of trees, and even earth, are used, to obtain a temporary shelter;
and in such a way as generally to result in the erection of non-
portable constructions, which are to be considered huts rather

<pb>
than tents. So the impossibility of obtaining materials from
which a portable shelter can be made, has often forced modern
armies to have recourse to equally primitive means of defence
against the inclemency of the weather. Wherever the materials
from which tents might be constructed have existed in abun-
dance, a preference has generally been given to that material
which was supposed to answer the purpose best at the least cost.
If the Romans used skins, it was because they were cheaper
than woven stuffs, and because they better protected, from the
rain, both the men and their arms. If the Syrians used, and still
use, tents of cloth, it was —it is, because woven fabrics have long
been easily obtained in the East, and because, while lighter than
skins, they afford a shelter quite sufficient, in climates mild and
comparatively rainless. Indeed, the Tartars and the nomads, of
the more rainy portions of Asia, have always used tent coverings
of felt or of skins.
The Syrian tents of woven fabrics were only introduced into
Europe, when the materials from which they were made had
become abundant and relatively cheap, and when the importance
of using, for military purposes, the lightest and most portable
tents, began to be understood.
The permeability of canvas coverings to rain, has always been
considered an objection to their use in Europe, and a variety of
special remedies for this evil have been adopted as well as sug-
gested. A sharper pitch than is common in Syrian tents, has
generally been given to the roof of the European tent. In the
East, wherever the weather is generally fine, probably the most
common form used is that of the rectangular pavilion; the pitch of
the roof is frequently wholly one way, and is commonly very slight.
In the West, wherever the pavilion form may have been adopted,
the roof has not only had a double pitch, but the angle enclosed
has been quite sharp. So also, it has been found expedient in
the West to adopt the Eastern sur-tente, or "fly," but curiously
enough the fly, having one principal object in view as used
in the East, was adopted in the West, principally for another
purpose: in the East, the fly is rarely used except as a sun
shade or parasol, in the West, the fly is rarely used except as an
umbrella.
<pb>
An attempt has been made to render the common single
canvas tents of the troops less permeable to rain, by restrict-
ing them to wedge-shaped or sharply conical forms. It has
been often stated, although originally, I believe, by Di Marsigli,
that the Turks were in the habit of making their tents very low
and flat-roofed, because, accustomed to sit upon cushions on
the ground, there was no occasion that their tents should be
lofty in any part. Now the Turkish conical tent is certainly
flatter than are the conical tents most used in Europe and the
United States, but the reasons for the flatness of the roof are,
because the roof is less frequently called upon to serve as a
watershed, and because, by making it less sharply conical the
tent stands more securely, and a considerable economy is obtained
in the ground-surface covered.1
The material of which modern tent-coverings have been made
has always been some sort of woven stuff, and generally the
tissue has been of linen. Toile is the common word used to
specify it by French writers of the eighteenth century, and this
word was apph' cable to "any simple tissue composed solely of
linen or hemp." 2 I have elsewhere stated that the cannoniere
was made of toile d'Alenqpn; and Colombier says, this was assez
epaisse—moderately heavy. Tents were sometimes said to have
been made of coutil; but this was only "grosse toile" used for
"bed-ticks, bolsters, pillows, and tents." 3
The "Encyclopedie," in speaking of the use made by . the
Tartars of felt, in the construction of tent-coverings, proposes
1 I may note a fact with which old campaigners are familiar. The sides of all
conical tenta can be made to incline more or less sharply, or in other words, the
height of the tent can be diminished, and the base diameter increased, by sinking
the mast in the earth, while by planting the mast above the level of the ground, the
dimensions of the tent are inversely changed.
Barth recommends for African travelling, "a strong, spacious, and low tent,"
and again he says:—" All tents intended for travellers in hot climates should be well
lined, and not too high. Those which we received (from'the English Government)
were quite unfit for the country whither we were going, and while they could hardly
withstand a strong blast of wind, they scarcely excluded the sun, particularly after
a little wear and tear." (" Travels and Discoveries in North and Central Africa,"
by Henry Barth. Philadelphia, 1865; p. 29.)

<pb>
the employment of that material in the construction of tents for
military purposes; but the suggestion would never appear to
have been adopted.
Puysegur, however, seems to have successfully suggested that
tent-coverings might prove less permeable and more durable
if made of a sort of oil-cloth;1 at least it is said that, towards
the close of the last century, heavy canvas, made of flax or tow,
and covered with a composition principally of wax or resin, was
occasionally used "to cover tents, gun carriages, waggons, and
carts for the army." 2
It is very difficult to ascertain now the exact grades or qualities
of the tissues most commonly employed in the French service for
tent coverings, even during the first half of the present century.
Occasionally hemp canvas—or rather, toile ecrue—has been used
for the tents of the superior officers, although these have gene-
rally, more recently, been made of coutil; and often this ticking
has been striped with blue, in which case the tissue has been
made partly of cotton. The troop-tents have generally been
made of fight flax canvas.
M. Michel LeVy and E. Boisseau have concluded a summary
account of tents, by observing:—"The subject of tents, which
has been greatly complicated, is in reality very simple; their
construction has been determined by a few general principles
only. The frame-work is evidently the essential part, since it
establishes the form and capacity of the tent, and no rational
classification can rest on any other basis. From this point of
view tents may be divided: first,—into tents having a single mast;
secondly,—into tents having two masts, with or without ridge poles;
thirdly,—into tents having several masts or props; fourthly
and finally,—into tents without masts."3
This classification is, however, wholly impossible, as it would
bring into the same group the marquee and the wedge tent, con-
structions entirely unlike each other, not only in form and
capacity, but in several other specific respects. The fact is, that
the mechanism of the frame of a portable tent is quite a

<pb>
secondary matter, and one which commonly, both practically
and in principle, has very little to do either with the form,
capacity, or value of the tent. The writers quoted have, however,
remarked with great justice, that the question of tents has been
much confused by the disposition shown by every inventor of
the slightest modification, to attach his name to the tent thus
modified.
But setting aside minor differences, tents cannot be well clas-
sified on any one basis. If classified according to form, the groups
might be named the " wedge" the "conical" the "pyramidal"
and, for the want of better words, the "tower-shaped" and the
"house-shaped." Under the tower-shaped would be included the
dome-crowned pavilions of antiquity and the middle ages, and
small circular tents with flat roofs, like the modern French
tente de conseil, nouveau modele; under the house-shaped, marquees,
rectangular pavilions, and many of the so-called "wall-tents."
When classified according to the materials of which the coverings
are made, we should have in separate groups, tents of skin, of
felt, and of cloth—those of the last group, subdivided according to
the nature of the cloth, into goat's hair, woollen, linen, cotton,
impermeable water-proof coverings of oil-cloth, &c. &c. If classi-
fied according to a very important point in construction, tents
might be divided into double tents, single tents, and single tents
with double roofs. Or they might be divided into two great and
widely-different groups—into tents having perpendicular walls,
and tents having inclined walls; or into tents drawn out and sus-
tained by cordage, and tents which maintain their form and steadi-
ness without cordage.
It will be seen at once, how difficult it is to classify objects
which, although possessing certain features in common, yet differ
from each other in so many very essential respects. If the
writers referred to have failed to establish a satisfactory classifi-
cation of tents, I do not propose to offer in this place a better
one;. but in considering the qualities of a tent, I shall refer to
them in their relations to the several classes of tents—as deter-
mined by form, material, and other special peculiarities of con-
struction—to which the tent under consideration may be
assigned or compared.
<pb>
HE first tent, now in use, which I shall describe, is the
one known in the British service as the "marquee," or
"hospital marquee." This tent is a very old one, and
its form is so exactly represented in Fig. 17, page 325, that
a verbal description of it will be readily understood. As has been
already observed, the " marquee" is a double tent, a large outer
tent completely enveloping a smaller one—the true tent. The
average distance between the two tents is about eighteen inches.
The inner tent is 28 ft. long, 15 ft. wide, and 12 ft. high.1 The in-
ferior part has the form of an ellipsoid, enclosed by walls 5 ft. high;
from the line where the walls join the edge of the roof, the in-
terior space has the form of a triangular prism, to the ends of which
are attached two hemicones. The tent is supported within by
three standards and a ridge-pole, each formed of two pieces. The
standards are planted in the ground on a line in the plane of the
long axis of the tent, one in the middle of this line, and one on
each side of the central standard, and 7 ft. distant from it. The
ridge-pole is 14 ft. long; and it supports the outer tent. The
ridge of the inner tent is held up by a series of " slings " fastened
to the ridge-pole. The outer and inner roofs are stretched out by
cords attached to pickets; forty cords, or "bracing lines," hold
the inner roof in its place ; forty-two cords are used for the outer
roof; in addition to these there are two "weather lines," each
1 These figures are taken from Dr. Thomas W. Evans's Report on "Voitures
et Tentes d'Ambulance," made to the French Commission at the time of the Expo-
sition of 1867, and are the measures of a "hospital marquee" then exhibited
by the British Government. But there is a singular disagreement among the
measures which I have seen in books. Thus, in the " Rapport de la Haute Com-
mission Militaire," the lengths of the long and short axes of the inner tent are
stated to be respectively 9 m. 20 and 4 m. 50. Parkes, without stating whether
his measurements refer to the inner or outer tent, says :—" Length, 33 ft.; breadth,
12 ft.; height, 12 ft.; total cubic space, 3,366 ft." He states in a note, however,
that the measurements apply to " the older pattern —the new pattern is a little Itss."
<pb>
90 ft. long. The inside walls are made of four separate
pieces, as are also the outside walls. The inside and outside
walls are hooked on to their respective roofs, and fastened by
means of loops to wooden pegs driven into the ground. One
hundred and eighty-four pegs, large and small, are used to retain
the marquee in position.
The tent has two doors facing each other, one on each side.
The walls or curtains, both on the outside and on the inside, can be
raised up or detached if necessary. There are besides four hooded
ventilators, or openings in the roof. The English Government has
also provided the marquee with a waterproof floor-cloth made
of painted canvas. The material of which the coverings are made
is light brown linen canvas of good quality; 362 yards of this
are required for each tent. The weight of the marquee (in-
cluding pegs) is 507 lbs.; the waterproof floor-cloth weighs
145 lbs.; the total weight of the tent is therefore 652 lbs. The
Government estimate of the cost of a marquee complete is £28.
Qualities.—This tent possesses certain merits. It is large and
spacious, cubing sufficient space for a considerable number of sick
—twelve or fourteen. The outer covering renders it quite imper-
meable to rain. It is easily kept warm—more easily even than a
common camp hut. In no hospital tent can better conditions be
maintained for a limited number of men than in this, although it
is not always easy to keep it as well aired as may be desirable.
"The usual method of ventilating marquees is by opening or rais-
ing the sides; but this can hardly be said to be sufficient, even in
favourable weather, and still less is it so when from rain or high
wind the sides cannot be opened. Even in fine weather it was
remarked that the air under the roof of the marquee was hot and
stagnant, although the sides were open, because there was no
provision for its escape above. What is really wanted to render
the ventilation sufficient is to make large and properly pro-
tected apertures around the top of each pole; were this done a
marquee would be rendered far more suitable for a field-hospital
than it is at present."1 It is probable that were the suggestion
1 Report of the Sanitary Commission, presented to both Houses of Parliament,
1857; pp. 138-139.
<pb>
here made adopted, the evil referred to might be obviated. It is
evident that a tent completely shut in by another, an air space
intervening, must ventilate itself slowly—the air stagnates be-
tween the walls; and even when the sides of the tent are raised,
a stratum of foul air may rest constantly overhead, or infection
may lurk in the coins morts of the folds of the canvas.
But the chief disadvantages of the marquee are its size, its
great weight, and its cost. It offers too much surface to the wind.
It was constantly being blown down in the Crimea, and will always
be exposed to this accident on temporary camping grounds where
the soil is loose, or it may be impossible to have recourse to
special means of support. Its great weight renders it difficult
of transportation. It was for this reason that few of the regi-
ments in the British army in the Crimea were able to obtain
their hospital marquees, embarked with them on shipboard, until
long after their arrival before Sebastopol, the surgeon making
such use as he was able, in the meantime, of the miserable shelter
of "one bell-tent."1 Such an experience enforces in the most
practical way the importance of not making tents so large and
heavy that the transportation of one even may become a burden.
I have also a theoretical objection against the English marquee:
its construction does violence to one of the first principles of
common economy. The exterior tent serves only to render the
shelter less permeable to rain, wind, and frost. Now this
exterior tent is twice as large, twice as heavy, twice as difficult
to carry, and twice as costly as the one it protects. Great im-
permeability, to wet especially, is certainly an excellent property
in a tent; but each degree of such impermeability has an abso-
lute value, and whoever may pay in various ways for a high
degree of this special excellence more than it is absolutely or
relatively worth, is sure to make a bad bargain. If one has a
jewel, it may be desirable to have a case to keep it in; but it is
a poor jewel which is worth less than its casket.
The "bell-tent" used in the British army is a troop-tent, and
has been used for hospital purposes only in emergencies. Its

<pb>
form is indicated by its name: it is a round tent, with perpen-
dicular walls, one or two feet high, and a conical roof, supported
by a central pole and short stay-ropes (see Fig. 18); the diameter
of its base is 14 ft., its height 10 ft., and the area of its base
154 square feet. It cubes about 512 ft., and is presumed to be
capable of sheltering on the march from twelve to fifteen men.
It weighs when dry 65 or 70 lbs. The covering is of linen
canvas of fair quality, although it has occasionally been made of
cotton canvas.
Qualities.—As originally constructed the bell-tent was quite

without means of ventilation; "now a few holes are made in
the canvas near the pole;" but these apertures are of little
service. During the middle of the day in warm weather the
tent is hot and uncomfortable, and even when unoccupied, the air
within it soon loses its freshness and becomes close and oppres-
sive to those entering the tent.
Captain Galton, in speaking of this tent, says:—" It is so
peculiarly objectionable, as to make it a matter of surprise that
it was ever invented and used. It is difficult to pitch, it requires
many tent-pegs, it has ropes radiating all around it, over which
men and horses stumble, and it is incommodious and ugly." 1 The

<pb>
regulation bell-tent has been the subject of various modifications,
the most important of which has been an addition to the height
of the perpendicular walls. The interior of the tent is thus made
more convenient, and as the sides can be looped up, the tent is
much better fitted for service in tropical climates.
A number of tents have, since twenty or thirty years, been
"invented" in England, some of which possess real merit;
although I believe I am correct in stating that none of these
inventions, whether " patented " or not, have been on any occa-
sion adopted by the English Government.
One of these is known as " Edgington's three-poled tent." This
tent is supported by three poles, sunk in the ground on the same
line, a central tall pole, before and behind which are the shorter
poles. The tent when stretched out has two ends and six sides;
the ends are short vertical isosceles triangles; the sides are formed
each of one tall inclined isosceles triangle and two tall inclined
scalene triangles. (See Fig. 19.)
These tents are made of dif-
ferent sizes ; that of medium
size covers a ground surface
14 ft. 6 in. square, is designed
to accommodate fourteen men,
with knapsacks, rifles, &c., and
weighs when packed with its
fixtures 172 lbs. This tent has
but two exterior stay ropes, and the covering is fastened to the
ground by a small number of pegs.
, In some of Edgington's tents the central pole is so contrived
as to be used as a stove-pipe, while an opening at the apex of
the tent is designed to serve as a ventilator.
The material of which these tents are made is linen canvas,
coloured or uncoloured. A lining is often employed, which,
forming a sort of inner tent, makes the construction warmer in
the winter and cooler in the summer.
Qualities.—Edgington's tent stands very firmly, and is un-
doubtedly one of the best single-roofed tents 'now used. Its
chief fault is, that its pointed form and the pitch of its roof are
such that it must always remain a single-roofed tent; no awning

<pb>
can be placed over it. This fault it has in common with
conical tents. It has also, although in a less degree, a fault
peculiar to them, as also to all tents with sloping walls—a want
of space in the upper part of the tent, with a waste of space in
the lower part. Moreover, the two storm-ropes by which the
tent is stayed are highly inconvenient. They are fastened just
where such ropes should not be—obstructing the entrance of the
tent. One or two straggling ropes attached to a tent are a cause
of accidents more frequently than the numerous stay-ropes of a
marquee or wall tent, which may be seen, and thus avoided.
The provisions for securing ventilation are also very imperfect
and insufficient.
Major Godfrey Rhodes, the author of "Tents and Tent Life,"
has invented a "patent" tent, in the construction of which he
states that he has had especially in view solidity, roominess, &c.
Major Rhodes's tent is a sort of "umbrella tent," that is to
say, his tent is not stretched out by cords and pickets, but is
stretched over a framework, either circular or oblong. This
framework is made of bamboo poles, the number depending upon
the size of the tent. In his "field " tent they all spring from a
central ring, as the ribs of an umbrella. The ends of the poles
when forced into the ground, form a dome-shaped framework,
which supports the covering. This is held down by the poles
themselves, which pass through the loops of a twisted cord, that
lies in a circular form upon the ground, and to which the cover-
ing is attached by straps.
In the oblong "hospital" tent—a sketch of which is shown in
Fig. 20—the bamboo poles are united together in a series of semi-
circles. No central poles are employed in these tents, and only
a small number of pegs are used; the "field " tent is quite un-
provided with pegs and stay-ropes. The coverings are of cotton
canvas. The " hospital" tent is 30 ft. long, 15 ft. wide, and 10 ft.
high, and weighs 395 lbs. It is intended to give accommodation
to twenty sick.
Qualities.—These tents are well shaped to resist the wind, and
are remarkably roomy. The tents, in a word, are unquestionably
good ones; but I am inclined to doubt if they are as sturdy as
Major Rhodes would have us believe. I remember once having
<pb>
had an occasion to use a tent constructed on the same general prin-
ciple, that is to say, without outside pickets and stay-ropes, and
without a central pole, but supported by perhaps a dozen light ash
ribs, at the foot of each of which was a flat perforated metallic plate
holding an iron pin nearly a foot in length, and forced into the
ground when the tent was pitched. This tent was constantly
being upset by the wind, and the only way I could keep it over-
head was by attaching to it two or three storm-ropes, after which
it behaved like any other well-regulated tent. One fault of
Major Rhodes's "patent" is, that its sides cannot be conveniently
raised; but its principal and fatal fault is to be found in its ex-
cessively complicated construction.
 
Fig. 20.—Major Rhodes's hospital tent.
With reference to the impermeability to rain which these tents
may possess, I may make a general remark : the fewer points
of support a piece of canvas covering touches, other things being
equal, the less permeable it is. A piece of cotton canvas (duck),
when stretched out, if unsupported, is quite impermeable to rain;
if it rest, either by design or accident, upon a bit of wood, or
any hard substance, the water, if it rain, will soon almost
certainly be seen oozing through the canvas and trickling down
the side of the support. I could not confirm the accuracy of
this statement more completely than by referring to an observa-
<pb>
tion which Baron Larrey incidentally makes when speaking of
the leakage to which the French tente conique is liable :—" The
strings even, that serve as cordage within, become so many con-
duits along which the water flows." 1
The number of poles used to support the hospital tent—
twenty, exclusive of the ridge-pole—is inconveniently great. The
"bamboo," or other special poles, are liable to get broken, lost,
&c., and can in the field only be replaced by common heavy
poles. This tent is, moreover, single-roofed—a hospital tent
should always have a double roof. Major Rhodes, since
having written his book, seems himself to have been con-
vinced of the existence of numerous faults in the construc-
tion of his "hospital tent," as I learn it has been superseded
by "Major Rhodes's patent hospital marquee," which appears
to differ in no way—judging from the advertiser's wood-cut
and specifications—from the Government marquee, except in
having a " special frame." This frame consists of four upright
posts, supporting rafters, which are united by a ridge-pole. The
"curvilinear formed frame," the "pliable ribs," the "double
twisted ground-rope," the "metallic socket-pieces," all the dis-
tinctive features of Major Rhodes's really original tent have thus
apparently been relegated to the limbo of impracticability, by
the inventor himself.
Mr. George Turner has also invented a tent, which he com-
mends highly for its stability, ventilation, &c. (See Fig. 21.)
This tent is circular in form; it is 10 ft. high, and 16 ft. in dia-
meter; it has a roof and walls. The roof is in the form of a cone,
16 ft. in diameter at its base, from which the walls fall per-
pendicularly to the ground. The tent is supported by a central
pole, and a framework of stays made of galvanized wire cord;
these stays radiate from a metallic collar adjusted to the top
of the pole, and are fastened to the ground by iron pegs, from
nine to twelve inches long. The stays are three-sixteenths
of an inch in diameter, and each one will stand a strain of 600 lbs.
The roof is made of "mineraUzed india-rubber double texture
fabrics ;" the walls are of common cotton canvas. Mr. Turner
1 "Rapport eur l'etat eanitaire du Camp de Chalons," par M. Le Baron Larrey.
Paris, 1857.
<pb>
has provided his tent with an arrangement for the suspension
of hammocks:—" By means of light wooden struts or rods,
one end being attached to a loop or eye fitted to the wire rope
stays, and the other hooking into a flange fitted at a convenient
distance from the bottom of the pole." Mr. Turner suggests the
use of the hammocks as "ambulance litters." The tent is
heated by means of a stove, the pipe of which forms the pole of
the tent. It is ventilated through an opening at the top, which is
shielded by a hood. This tent is designed to afford shelter for
eighteen men. With the waterproof covering and the fixtures

complete it weighs nearly or quite 300 lbs.; the covering alone
weighs 100 lbs.
Mr. Turner also speaks of a "novel and peculiar adaptation of
his system" for a general field hospital. He would cause six or
eight marquees to branch off from a common centre, in the form
of a star, so as to embrace a number of wards in connection, yet
separated one from the other :—" A construction of this nature,
with six wings each 60 ft. long by 16 ft. wide, would afford ac-
commodation for beds, and possess ample means for warmth and
ventilation, and effect a great saving in weight over the same
number of marquees containing equal accommodation if fitted
separately."1
1 "Journal of the Royal United Service Institution," vol. iv. No. xii. May, 1860,
p. 86.
<pb>
Qualities.—Mr. Turner's tents are doubtless very good tents;
still, a number of objections can be offered against them. With
their fittings they are heavy and complicated; the metallic
stays, whether supporting the tent or folded up with it, are con-
stantly wearing the canvas; the iron pegs are heavy and liable to
be lost, and, as has very justly been said of iron pegs:—" Then-
value to natives is so great, that to prevent loss by theft is next
to impossible."1 The India-rubber fabrics of which the roof is made
are objectionable from their impermeability to air. The idea of
using the mast of the tent as a stove-pipe is not an original one.
The suggestion was once made—and I believe to some extent it
was acted upon—that the mast of the U.S. " Sibley" tent could
be so used ; it was, however, soon found to be impracticable. A
pipe which is solid enough not to bend or be broken is altogether
too heavy to form a part of a tent ; moreover, a stove-pipe is too
dirty to be packed or stowed with a tent; while if the pipes are
stowed separately, one is exposed to all the inconvenience which
might arise should they not arrive on the camping ground with
the tents.
The British army has, up to the present time, made but very
little use of shelter-tents, although probably quite as large a
number of models have at different times been proposed in
Great Britain, as have been exhibited in countries where such
tents are more generally employed.
One of these models is described thus:—" Each man carries a
canvas sheet, made up of a quadrangular (5 ft. 9 in. X 5 ft. 3 in.)
and of a triangular piece (2 ft. 8 in. height of triangle X 5 ft.
3 in. base). Buttons and button-holes are sewed along three
sides, and a stick (4 ft. long and divided in the middle) and
three tent-pegs and rope also are provided. Two or four of
these sheets can be put together, the triangles forming the end
flaps. A very roomy and comfortable shelter-tent, 4 ft. in
height, is formed, which will, with a little crowding, accommo-
1 "Shifts and Expedients of Camp Life," by W. B. Lord andT. Baines. London,
1868, p. 64.
<pb>
date six men, so that two sheets can go on the ground."1 This
tent weighs 6 lbs. 14 oz. per man.
Another quite similar tent has been proposed. The tent is
formed of two sections—oblong pieces of canvas, which in shape
may be said to be square pieces (about 7 ft. in length and breadth)
elongated by attaching to the opposite ends triangles having from
base to apex a length of about 4 ft. The sections are furnished
with rows of buttons and corresponding button holes on their
inner edges; and they are supported by two sticks or standards
4 ft. 4 in. in length, and an inch in diameter; each one is divided
into two sections that it may be the more portable. When the
tent is pitched the triangular flaps close the ends of the tent
snugly, overlapping widely if they fall perpendicularly; but they
are generally stretched out so as to form a cul-de-lampe, or porch,
at each end of the tent. Thus arranged, the tent is 4 ft. 4 in.
high, 7 ft. in breadth, and 10 ft. 8 in. in length. This tent
affords plenty of room for two men. A section, one of the tent-
poles, and half of the pegs, weigh 8 lbs. 2 oz.2
Without entering into a special discussion of the merits of these
models, I may state that I believe them both to be good ones.
They are somewhat larger and heavier than shelter-tents in gen-
eral. But the principal defect of shelter-tents is their very small
size; they are, when pitched, not only not comfortable, but they
are also often scarcely inhabitable, by reason of the open ends.
The two sections of both the tents just described forma complete
tent; and although the latter model weighs twice as much as the
French tente-abri, it is, as a shelter, incomparably superior. The
equipment of an English infantry soldier weighs 56 lbs. ; of a
Russian infantry soldier, 60 lbs.; of a Prussian infantry soldier,
63 lbs.; of a French infantry soldier, 69 lbs. As a principle, the
soldier should carry the smallest possible weight, and "should
not be made," as the Crown Prince of Prussia once remarked
in my presence, " a beast of burden." I believe the weights
generally carried by soldiers may be reduced with advantage.

p. 47.
<pb>
Nevertheless, it is evident that a difference of a few pounds
above or below the weight fixed upon as the proper average to
be carried, is a matter of no great consequence if any important
object is to be attained thereby; and I know of none more
important than that which has in view the assurance of a
suitable shelter for the soldier.
I may conclude this account of English shelter-tents by men-
tioning a portable shelter highly commended by Parkes as "an
improvement over the French tent and better than the American
poncho tent." Each section or sheet is prepared with a hood, and
is intended to be worn as a cloak on the march. Two sections form
a tent for three men, the third sheet being spread on the ground.
Sticks, pegs, &c., do not form a necessary part of the equipment;
rifles, &c., being used to support the tent in the absence of sticks.
I have never seen a specimen of this tent, and am consequently
unable to appreciate its merits. It has, however, obvious defects.
A great number of attempts have been made to construct tents
of cloaks, overcoats, &c. One of the first tents of this kind—the
tente Reveroni—was proposed as early as 1726, and one of the last
figured in the collection of war material exhibited by the Dutch
Government at the Exposition of 1867. These tents have all
proved to be failures. An instrument made to serve a great
number of purposes is generally not well adapted for any one of
those purposes. A simple sheet of canvas forms a better tent
section than if a hood or any other attachment, foreign to its
use as a tent, be fitted to it. Common canvas is speedily ruined
if laid upon the ground. The use of rifles, swords, and bayonets
as supports is inadmissible; from a material point of view it is as
necessary they should be protected against wet as it is that the
soldier himself should be.1
Passing from English tents to French tents, and continuing
1 Since this page was written I have been informed that the Italian Government
has recently suppressed the supporting-sticks or bdtons of the tente-abri, for the
purpose of lightening the weight to be carried by the soldier, and has directed that
the tent be sustained by muskets. The fact is sufficiently important to be
stated. I am not induced by it, however, to change any opinion which I have
advanced concerning this method of propping up tents.
<pb>
my special subject, I may observe, first, that the tente-abri has in
principle been long employed. Rhodes says the Macedonians
used small tents intended for two men, but he gives no authority
for his statement; in any event, it is highly probable that such
tents may have been used in ancient times, as may be inferred
from the existence of the diminutives of aKJ/vrj and tentorium
(oKtiv&iov and tent&riolum).
But to come down to more modern times: in an engraving,
which I have, representing an attack upon a town and camp on
the Ems, and bearing the date of 1568, there are quite a number
of representations of small wedge tents which could scarcely have
sheltered more than two persons. As every soldier had at this
time to provide himself with a shelter as best he could, it is very
probable that tents were often made of small pieces of woven
stuff, which the soldier himself could carry, and which, propped
up by some simple framework, afforded a cover at night, not
unlike that which is still a favourite domicile among the
Gipsies.
One of the earliest, certainly one of the most singular, accounts
of the use of shelter-tents, is that given by Patten in a descrip-
tion of the Scots mode of encampment, just after the battle of
Pinkey, in 1547 :—
"Here now to say sumwhat of the maner of their campe: As
they had no pauilions or round houses, of ony commendable cum-
pass, so wear theer fewe oother tentes with posts, as ye used maner
of makying is: And of these fewe also, none of abooue xx. foot
length, but most far vnder; for the most part all very sump-
tuously beset (after their facion) for the love of Fraunce, with
Fleur-de-lices, sum of blue buckeram, sum of black and sum of
oother colours. These whyte ridges (as I calld them), that as
we stood on Fauxsyde Bray, dyd make so great mouster toward
vs, which I dyd take then to be a number of tentes; when we
cam, we found it a lynnen draperie of the coorser camryk in
dede, for it was all of canuas shetes, and wear the tenticles, or
rather cabayns and couches of theyr souldiours; the which (much
after the common bylding of their countree beside) had they
framed of iiii. sticks, about an elle long a pece, whearof ii.
fastened toogyther at one end aloft, and the ii. endes beneath
<pb>
stict in the ground, an elle a sunder, standing in facion lyke the
bowe of a soowes yoke: Over ii. such bowes (one as it wear at
their hed, thoother at their feet) they stretched a shete doun on
both sides, whearby their cabain becam roofed lyke a ridge, but
skant shit at both endes, and not very close beneath on the
sydes, onles their stiks wear the shorter, or their wiues the more
liberal to lend them larger naperie: Howbeit, win they had lyned
them, and stuft them so thick with strawe, when they were couched,
thei wear as warme as thei had bene wrapt in horse dung."1
The French account of the origin of the tente-abri is sufficiently
curious to be worthy of mention. It seems that after the
abolition of tents in the armies of the Republic, the disastrous
effects of prolonged bivouacs became so evident, that a some-
what singular practice was not only permitted, but was officially
recognized and encouraged. There was always a necessity in
the army for a considerable number of long strong sacks, called
sacs a distribution, for the transportation of bread, vegetables,
grain, &c. These the soldiers, in the absence of other shelter,
began to use, whenever they could get hold of them, as sleeping
bags. The Ordinances of 1778 sanctioned this novel use of the
sacks. By an Ordinance of the year II., one sack was issued to
each man; it soon became known in the army as the sac de
campement, and was subsequently extensively used by the troops
as a shelter in all active campaigns. The armies which were
sent to Algiers from 1830 to 1840 were supplied with such sacks.
But the discovery was made by certain soldiers engaged in those
expeditions that the sac de campement was much less serviceable
as a sleeping bag than when used as a roof. That they might the
better make these roofs, the soldiers were frequently permitted to
rip open their sacks; and shortly after whole regiments were to
be seen camped in the little tents which they were thus enabled
to construct. This sort of shelter was in very general use in the
French army, when in the field, until the invention was recognized
by the issue of the regulation tente-abri in 1848.
The tente-abri of the French army is formed of two rectangular
1 Quoted by Scott, in " The British Army; its Origin, Progress and Equipment,"
vol. ii. pp. 472, 473.
BB
<pb>
pieces of canvas, 5 ft. 9 in. long (1 m. 76) by 5 ft. 4 in. wide
(1 m. 64). These two pieces are buttoned together longitudinally,
and the canvas, raised upon two sticks (bdtons), the ends of
which pass through two small holes in the outer edges of the
canvas, is stretched out by its lower borders so as to form a
wedge-shaped roof open at both ends. The weight of one section,
one support, and three pegs, is 1 kil. 690 grammes—or about
3 lb. 11 oz. As each soldier, on entering upon a campaign, is
furnished with a section which he carries as a part of his "kit,"
he is able to form at any time with one or more of his comrades
a shelter, that is certainly vastly better than none.
For active campaigning a tent of this sort is almost indispens-
able. Its uses are, however, very strictly limited to furnishing a
shelter for soldiers who are well. It is not necessary in this
place, therefore, to consider at length either its merits or defects.
One of its defects is very apparent—the rectangular piece of
canvas is too small; the consequence is that the tent is both too
narrow and too short ; it is not long enough to cover the body of
a moderately tall soldier.
This defect has been the occasion of numerous attempts to con-
struct other models of tente-abri, some of which in several respects
are certainly improvements upon the regulation model. One of
these—M. Waldejo's tent—is made of lozenge-shaped pieces of can-
vas, the sides of which are 2 metres long. When two of these
are buttoned together and propped by a central stick, the canvas
forms a pyramidal tent about 1^ metres high, resting upon a base
2 metres square. With four pieces a much larger tent can be
made; indeed the unitary section and its buttons and button-
holes are arranged for a variety of combinations. Although this
tent has never been adopted by any Government, the tests to
which it has been put have been the occasion of a number of
favourable official reports to the French Government. Its great
merits are that, without being heavier it is much more roomy
than the common model, and that with two sections a completely
closed tent can be made.
As early as 1860 M. Barbe proposed to give to the ordinary
section of a tente-abri the form of an isosceles triangle, with a
base breadth of 1 m. 76, and a height or length of 3 m. 28.
<pb>
By uniting three or more of these triangular sections, pyramidal
tents could be constructed offering conditions quite similar to
those of the Waldejo model. Whatever the advantages of the
modifications suggested, the simplicity of the rectangular sheet
has always been so strong a point in its favour, that it has been
nearly everywhere adopted as the best section for a shelter tent.1
Inasmuch as in the campaigns of 1866 and of 1870, the
Germans entered the field unprovided for the most part with
tents of any kind, the suggestion has recently been made by
certain writers that the shelter-tent could, with advantage, be
dispensed with. Such an opinion I cannot entertain. During
the whole war of 1870 the German armies suffered immensely
from being deprived of shelter. The waste of men from
diarrhoea, pneumonia, rheumatism, and fever, caused by avoid-
able exposure, would have often put a stop to the movements
of these armies had they not been constantly strengthened by
reinforcements, and to an extent unparalleled in modern war.
Germany proposed a short campaign, and men were the cheapest
part of her war material, while to France they were the most
costly. To have engaged upon a campaign where half or two-
thirds of the army on both sides should have been disabled in a
month, simply by excessive fatigue and exposure, would have
subjected France to the power of Germany without a battle.
This consideration shaped in part German tactics, which, under
the special circumstances, may have been quite justifiable from a
strictly military point of view. It would be impossible, how-
ever, to deduce from an exceptional fact a general rule. More-
over, the practice of quartering troops—a whole army—upon
the inhabitants of the towns, villages, and cities, in the country
where the war may be conducted, is an abomination. It is in
the end subversive of military discipline, is demoralizing and
brutalizing to the soldiery, is an invasion of those personal
rights recognized by the laws of modern war, and, by debauching

the morality of the people, becomes an arm of warfare only
worthy of savages.
No tent of special construction has yet been allowed by the
French Government for the shelter of the sick of its armies.
Three troop-tents of different models are now in use in the
French service, which are employed, whenever it may seem
necessary, for the hospitalization of the sick.
The "tente nouveau modele," or "bonnet de police," is the
most ancient, having been authorized by an "Instruction" of the
year III.
This tent has the form of a triangular prism, to the ends of
which are joined two hemi-cones. It covers an elliptical ground
surface 19 ft. 8 in. long and 13 ft. wide; the tent is 9 ft. 10 in.
high. The covering is supported by two standards and a ridge-
pole ; the ridge-pole is 6 ft. 8 in. long; a shelf also—planche a
pain—is placed between the two vertical poles, steadying them,
and forming a convenient place upon which to put, or from
which to suspend, the effects of the soldiers. The canvas is
fastened to the ground by short looped cords attached to twenty-
three wooden pickets. Two curtain-shaped doors give entrance
to the tent; the doors are closed with straps and side-buckles,
or may be opened, and held out horizontally by two small props.
The tent weighs 130§ lbs., cubes 24 metres, and was originally
intended to accommodate sixteen men. It was made of brown
linen canvas for the troops, and of striped cotton and linen
canvas for the officers.
Qualities.—It is well-formed and fairly solid; it is secured by
few tent-ropes; it is not heavy, and can be readily pitched and
struck. The objections to its use, particularly as a hospital tent,
are these:—First,—its permeability. French tent canvas is al-
most uniformly of an inferior quality; it is not firmly woven,
and the rain is sure to sift through a single roof formed of it, in
the most uncomfortable manner. Secondly,—no sufficient pre-
cautions have been taken to have the tent well aired. Baron
Larrey, speaking of this tent, has observed:—" When the doors
are closed, and the tent is thus shut up, the air becomes rapidly
so close and hot as to interfere with respiration; at the same time
it becomes infected with the odours of straw, leather, and emana-
<pb>
tions of various kinds. Hence spring the pernicious consequences
of overcrowding, and the diseases which break out among men
who remain seven or eight hours out of twenty-four surrounded
by such an atmosphere." 1
The 'a',bonnet de police" is at present little used, none having
been made for the Government since several years; the reputed
cause of its having been condemned was a want of solidity,
exhibited particularly in the Crimea, on the 14th of November,
1854, when the tents of this model, then largely used by the
troops, were nearly all blown down.
The "tente Tacconet," or "tente elliptique," was introduced
into the army about forty years ago. It is claimed to be an
invention of the house Tacconet of Paris, "fournisseurs ;" and, as
a sample of tent architecture, was presumed, when adopted, to
have left scarcely anything to be desired, as may be inferred from
the following rather florid encomium :—" Their researches, pre-
cious discoveries, and unfaltering zeal, have gifted France with a
camping material unequalled in Europe; our camps of instruc-
tion have become objects of curiosity and envy. The house
Tacconet has furnished models to almost all the Powers of
Europe. Turkey and the Barbary States have in their turn
wished to have our tents; and even the Dey of Tunis has asked
for one, which has been made for him expressly. In short, our
castrametation has become an art."2 It is but proper to say that
this tent is only a slight modification of that just described; it
had nearly the same form, was supported in the same manner,
and sheltered the same number of men; in one respect it was
inferior—the officers' tents of the nouveau modele having been
provided very generally during the early part of the century
with sur-tentes, or double roofs. It possessed in general, how-
ever, the same qualities. During the Mexican war the "tente
Tacconet" was used quite exclusively by officers. Although it is
still to be seen in French encampments, the Government has

ceased since several years to give orders for its construction. A
sketch of this tent is shown in Fig. 22.
The "tente conique," or "marabout," is a copy, with slight
modifications, of the circular tent used by the Turks. It is sup-
ported by a single pole, and, when stretched out, has an interior
diameter at its base of 18 ft. 8 in., and a height of 10 ft. 8 in. It
has a curtain or wall 14 in. high (36 centimetres), which drops
down vertically around its base, and is pegged to the ground
on the inside of the tent. To each breadth of canvas, at its
junction with the curtain, is attached a short cord, which, fas-

tened to a picket, serves to stay out the tent. The extreme
diameter of the tent from picket to picket is 6 m. 80, or about
22 ft. 4 in. There are two doors in the tente conique, arranged
as in the bonnet de police and the tente elliptique. At the sum-
mit of the mast is a cap, that overhangs an opening in the top
of the covering, formed by a metallic ring, about twelve inches
in diameter, over which the canvas is sewed. The opening is in-
tended to serve as a ventilator, and is regulated by lifting up or
depressing the cap.
The material of which this tent is made is brown linen canvas;
<pb>
its weight is 72 kilogrammes, about 158 lbs.;1 and. its cost, 239
francs.2 It cubes 30 metres, and is intended to furnisb a shelter
for sixteen men. (See Fig. 23.)
Qualities.—The conical form is the one which insures the
greatest stability to a tent; a fact of importance in itself, and of
additional importance since the stability given by the form alone
enables one to dispense with the use of long and inconvenient
stay-ropes. The tent can be easily ventilated by raising a sec-
tion of the curtain, while the opening at the top always permits

a certain escape of air. The tente conique is easily pitched and
struck. It is a good troop-tent, and, if made of less permeable
stuff, would be an excellent one.
Its great fault, especially when considered as a hospital tent, is
its permeability. The canvas is not sufficiently close, and is also
too pliable; the rain sifts through it, or if caught in its loose
folds, nlters through into the interior.3
The "appel d'air" at the summit of the tent is not suffi-
1 In the article on camps in the "Dictionnaire Encyclopedique des Sciences
Medicales," published by M. Victor Masson, it is said the marabout weighs 57'50
kilogrammes; probably this weight does not include that of the pole, pegs, &c.
Seventy-two kilogrammes is the official weight.
2 This is the price given in the "Rapport de la Haute Commission Militaire."
The estimated price at the Intendance is as follows:—Canvas, 67 m. 60 at 1 f. 70
per metre = 114-92 francs; cost of making up with the accessories= 57'65 francs;
total cost, 172-57 francs.

whenever a Frenchman says of his tent, "die tamise," he means to say, "It leaks
like a sieve."
<pb>
ciently large; moreover, at one metre (39-37 inches) from
the centre, it forces the men to stoop in moving about.1 In
a word, it lacks roominess, a fault which it has in common with
all conical, wedge, and pyramidal tents. When such tents are
used by troops, the space within their outer borders may be almost
wholly utilized, and the inconvenience resulting from the pitch of
their roofs may be of no great consequence ; but when the sick
are treated in such tents, either the space represented by the
apex of the ground angle is almost wholly lost, or the inconveni-
ence of the sloping roof will be found by the surgeon quite
intolerable.
Moreover, in addition to the difficulty of being always able to
use advantageously the space within conical tents, their interior
cubic capacity, as compared with the ground they cover, is in
reality considerably less than that of tents having other forms.
The conical form is the most expensive form which is em-
ployed in the construction of tents. The "tente conique" with a
diameter at its base almost equal to that of the long diameter of
the " bonnet de police"—and requiring in its construction nearly
twice as much canvas—has a capacity only six cubic metres
larger than the "bonnet de police."
The French also occasionally use a "marquise." It is de-
signed, however, especially for general officers, and as a place of
council; an "Instruction" of the year XII. gave to each
colonel or commander of a regiment such a tent in addition to
the tent used as a lodging.2 This marquee has a double roof
and double walls; the walls are about a yard high, and the
outer roof, bordered with a festoon, projects over them. It has
the same size as the "tente Tacconet."3
Qualities.—It can be fairly well ventilated by raising the walls
by means of a double system of cordage:—" It is the model the
best designed for the purpose had in view, and might with
certain modifications itself serve as a model for a large division
ambulance tent."4 (See Fig. 24.)

More recently a council tent has been introduced under
the name of "la tente de conseil du nouveau rnodele." This
construction may be described, in a word, as an umbrella tent.
It is a conical tent supported by a central mast 11 ft. 6 in.
high, from the upper part of which radiate eight horizontal bars,
each about 6 ft. in length, that serve to prop out the walls of
the tent. The diameter of the tent at its base is about 20 ft.
Two doors placed in opposite walls face each other.
Qualities.—This tent is spacious and roomy, and well adapted
for the purpose it is intended to serve. It is made, however, of
light and inferior canvas. Singularly enough the coverings of

the two council tents or "tentes d!officier" I have described, are
made of "coutil"—ticking, while the soldiers' tents are "en
toile "—canvas.
A hospital tent made by M. Le Fort in 1869, and adopted to
some extent by the French "Societe de Secours aux Blesses"
during the recent war, merits notice. As this tent, however, is
said by its inventor to have been designed with the purpose of.
remedying certain defects peculiar to "la tente americaine," I
shall reserve my description of it until I have indicated the
character and qualities of the tent, the inconveniences of which
M. Le Fort proposed to avoid.
Quite recently a model " surgeon's tent" has been made by
<pb>
the "Dock du Campement "—a Paris house—for the "Societ4
de Secours aux Blesses," and in accordance with the following
specifications, furnished by a committee of that society:—
The tent must be solid, light, portable, easy to pitch, and so
roomy that a surgical service of eight or ten persons can move
about within it, and work without inconvenience.
There should be room also for at least two amputation tables,
stretchers, cantines, instrument boxes, medicine cases, &c.
The ventilation should be sufficient for the escape of all emana-
tions, and the air within it should be renewable at will.
The light within should be sufficient for operating—even if the
tent is entirely closed.
The tent must be capable of being rapidly cleaned—freed from
straw, dirt, and detritus of all kinds.
It is also necessary that the access to the tent be made easy
for the stretcher-bearers, who should be able to go in and out
readily without difficulty, and without interfering with each
other.
In accordance with these specifications a tent was constructed
which very closely resembled the "tente elliptique" just described
—in fact, scarcely differed from it except in certain matters of
detail. The tent is at its base 8 metres long and 6 metres wide;
it is 3£ metres high. The framework, of pine, is composed of
six pieces—square—10 centimetres (4 inches) thick, fitted with
sockets, so as to form two standards, each 3£ metres high, and a
ridge-pole 3£ metres long. The covering is supported wholly
by this framework, and is secured simply by the pegs, which
fasten its border to the ground, no cords of any kind being
employed.
The tent has two doors; the one in front is 3£ metres high,
and nearly 6 metres broad; when closed it forms a side wall,
when opened and supported by two props it forms a sort of
portico in front of the tent (see Fig. 22); the second door in
the opposite side wall is smaller, and, fitted with straps and
buckles, is usually closed.
For purposes of ventilation, and that the tent may be the more
easily kept clean, at each end two large openings (baies) have
been cut quite down to the ground; these are each 80 centimetres
<pb>
wide and 90 centimetres high. The baies are so arranged as to
be readily opened or closed.
To increase the means of ventilation, four louvres (lucarnes)
have been inserted, two being placed in each end near the
summit of the tent. These openings are covered by raw hide
hoods. Four windows are also placed in the tent, partly as
ventilators and partly to secure light. The windows are placed
—two at each end—a little over a metre from the ground—
about half-way between the baies and the lucarnes; they are closed
by curtains, to which weights are attached, that slide down on
pulling a cord.
The tent is made of the best French regulation flax canvas
(du type ministiriel), weighing about 500 grammes (1 lb. l\ oz.)
per metre of 80 centimetres width.
The weight of the tent is about 110 kilogrammes (242 lbs.);
when rolled up it forms a bale 2 metres long, with a diameter of
65 centimetres.
The tent plainly made without inscriptions or ornaments of
any sort costs 575 francs.
Five persons should be able to pitch the tent in ten minutes.
Qualities.—This tent is intended for a special purpose—to be
used on the field by the ambulance volante simply as an operating
room. The form of the model is well adapted to the object in
view; it assures a fair degree of solidity, without cordage, and
makes it relatively easy to pitch and strike. The dimensions
render it to a certain extent free from a great objection to tents
with sloping walls—want of head room.
The provisions for opening the tent, whether for entrance,
exit, or the purpose of ventilation, are abundant.
Its special faults are these: The covering is made of linen canvas,
which, being only of a single thickness, is quite permeable. It
is particularly desirable that the interior of a tent for the ambu-
lance volante should be kept dry, as well for the preservation of
the instruments and the surgical and medical material there as-
sembled, as for the comfort of the persons who may be within it.
If it is not thought expedient to employ a fly, the covering of
such a tent should be made of cotton canvas. The lucarnes are
not sufficiently large to assure the ventilation, if it become
<pb>
necessary, on account of wind or rain, to close the doors, bates,
and windows. This objection might be partially obviated by
changing the place of the windows, which are now at the ends
and about half-way between the ground and the ridge—inserting
them in the roof above the doors.
A general objection to this tent might be offered on the
ground of its being limited to a special service. It is not a good
hospital tent on account of its permeability, and because it fails
to respond to certain conditions desirable in such a tent. The
numerous bates, windows, and doorways, serviceable as they may
be in an operating tent, are objectionable in an hospital tent, as
it is impossible to perfectly close them, and in cold, windy
weather they serve as inlets to disagreeable currents of air.
Altogether the model is an excellent one for the purpose
intended, and had it been made of cotton canvas instead of linen,
would scarcely have left anything to be desired.
Among the tent models exhibited at a "concours" of the
French "Societe de Secours aux Blesses," opened in February,
1873, was one contrived by M. De Moulnier. This tent was
said to have been intended to serve as a troop-tent, and also as
a hospital tent. The model was circular; it had walls 5 ft. high,
and was covered by a conical roof; its extreme height was 15 ft.,
and its diameter at the base 16 ft. It was supported by a central
pole, and by its walls. The walls consisted of 18 solid wooden
frames, 5 ft. by 3 ft., within which sheets of canvas were inserted.
These frames, jointed together and set up in a circular manner,
formed the walls. The roof was fastened to the sections of the
wall by means of loops and hooks. The framework employed in
this tent was strong and heavy, and the constructor appears to
have had recourse to it as a means of obtaining a secure support
for hammocks, sixteen of which were exhibited in the tent sus-
pended between the walls and the central mast.
Qualities.—The model was constructed quite regardless of
weight—a terminal ornament on the mast weighing ten or twelve
pounds, and apparently in utter ignorance of the most important
principles to be observed in the construction of an army tent.
At the same "concours," M. Couette exhibited a number of
tents, one of which is, perhaps, worthy of notice. It is a hip-roofed

tent, 10 ft. high and 18 ft. broad, its length to vary according to
circumstances. It is propped up by a series of supports about
6 ft. apart, and united by a ridge-pole, in sections. The supports
are each formed of four limbs—two long ones and two short
ones. The long limbs are united at the top by a hinge; when
opened, they form the branches of a compass, and when planted
in the ground are separated at their points by a distance of
4 ft. 6 in. From each branch of the compass, 6 ft. 4 in. from the
ground, springs a strut about 6 ft. long. The struts are united
to the branches of the compasses by hinges. All the limbs are
made of strong elastic wood, and are faced with a strip of iron;
being square in form, they fold up together compactly. When
the compasses have been erected, and the tent covering has been
thrown over the ridge, the struts prop out. the covering, giving
to it the form represented in Fig. 33. The roof has, however, a
second angle, as the covering is made with perpendicular side
walls, nearly a metre high, and is stayed out by cords which
emerge from the tent, on the lines upon which the side walls are
attached. The cords are bolt-roped across the inner face of the roof.
Qualities.—This tent would be simplified and improved by
suppressing the perpendicular side walls and the stay ropes.
The only noteworthy characteristic it possesses is its system of
support. This, in principle, is a very good one. The numerous
hinges are, however, objectionable; and iron sockets ought to
have been placed above each strut hinge, into which the foot of
an extemporized stretching piece could be put, should the hinge
be broken or the strut itself lost. M. Couette has placed in his
tent a number of net-work windows, which can be closed by
curtains. The advantages of this arrangement are questionable.1
1 The manteau d'armes, which is included by the French among the effets de
campement, is not unfrequently spoken of as a tent. It has never, however, been
used, as may be inferred from its name, for any purpose except to cover arms
and to protect them from wet. The company muskets being arranged around an
upright post en faisceau, were covered by a small 'conical tent, for which the up-
right post (chevalet d'armes) served as the pole. This tent was 6 ft. high and
18 ft. in circumference at the base. By the Ordinances of 1753 and 1788, two
manteaux d'armes were issued to each company. The manteau du chevalet de piquet
—covering arms resting against a horizontal bar—instead of being conical was
house-shaped, or en mansarde. The model in use in the French army in 1867
<pb>
The tents now in use in the Turkish army are of two kinds.
The one used by officers is a large conical tent, varying in
diameter from 14 ft. to 20 ft. It is supported by a central
mast, and is stayed by ropes attached to pickets. From the
base of the cone a wall or curtain drops vertically to the ground,
a distance of from 2 ft. to 4^ ft. The covering is made of
strong cotton canvas, and the inside is generally lined with some
coloured stuff also of cotton.
The tent furnished the troops is in form quite similar, although
generally somewhat smaller. It resembles very closely the
French "tente conique; " it differs from it, however, in being made
of doubled widths of cotton canvas, instead of linen canvas of
a single thickness, and in having walls which lap widely over each
other at the doorway, thus securing the inside more completely
against rain. The ventilation is also better provided for than in
the French tent, the opening at the top being larger and more
controllable. The Turks have employed also a hospital tent,
which is thus described by Major Rhodes:—" It is of a long oval
shape, supported by a pole at each end, and having a ridge-pole
or rope connecting both together; long ropes fastened to the sides
at about three feet off the bottom, and then pegged to the ground,
secure the tent. It is made of a doubled white cotton canvas."1
The Prussian "troop tent" is very similar to the English bell-
tent. It is 14 or 15 ft. in diameter, and is supported by a
central pole 11 ft. 8 in. high; it is intended to shelter fifteen
or eighteen men, and weighs 80 lbs.
The Prussian "hospital tent," as specified by the Regulation
of 1862, is constructed as follows :—" It has a rectangular base
64 (English) ft. long, by 25 ft. 9 in. wide. The base is
divided into three parts; the middle one is 53 ft. 9 in. long,
and the parts at the ends are about 5 ft. long. The middle
space is intended for the beds; the end compartments are
designed to lodge the personnel, and furnish a place for the
weighed, with the gun rack, 25-3 kilogrammes, and cost 55 64 francs. The manteau
(fames would appear to have been rarely used except in the French service—it
having been the custom in most armies for the soldier to stack his arms at night, or
in rainy weather, in his quarters or in his tent.

<pb>
necessary utensils. On a line running down the middle of
the tent are four posts, 16 ft. 6 in. high, intended to sup-
port the ridge-pole, which holds up the roof. The roof is
covered with sail-cloth tightly stretched, that the water may rest
at no point and thus filter into the tent. Impermeable canvas
may be employed, but it has the inconvenience of impeding the
circulation of air, and of increasing the heat to an insupportable
degree. Sail-cloth is therefore preferable."1
This tent is intended for fourteen beds, which are arranged
as shown in the diagram (Fig. 25). It is supported by a wooden
 
Fig. 25.—Ground plan of the Prussian hospital tent for fourteen beds.
framework of standards and plates, and is stayed by a multi-
tude of ropes attached to strong pickets, including eight storm-
ropes fastened to the main standards. The tent is not provided
with a double roof. Its general appearance when pitched is very
well presented in the illustration (Fig. 26).
I remember having seen at the Exposition of 1867 a model
Prussian hospital tent, somewhat smaller than the one de-
scribed, but very similar in its construction. It was an oblong
wall tent, 43 ft. 8 in. (English) long, about 20 ft. wide, and
14 ft. 3 in. high. The side walls were 5 ft. high. It was
divided into three compartments, as is the regulation tent, and
was supported by a tubular iron framework within, and by
cords and pickets without. Two circular ventilators were placed

1868; p. 13.
<pb>
in the roof. The tent had a second roof or fly, which was
attached to the roof, on the line of the angle of the side walls,
by a series of buttons. The canvas covering was of brown linen
of fair quality.
This tent was the subject of much criticism; nevertheless in
November, 1867, the Prussian Government resolved to adopt it,
with certain modifications, as will be seen from the following
account of the "Field hospital tent for twelve beds," which I
reproduce substantially from the official account then published.
The tent is house-shaped, 28 ft. (Prussian) long by 20 wide.
 
Fig. 26.—Appearance of a Prussian hospital tent for fourteen beds when pitched.
The side walls are 5 ft. high, and the distance from the ground
to the ridge is 13^ ft. It is supported by a framework com-
posed of straight sections of wrought tubular iron. The disposi-
tion of this framework is shown in the accompanying sketch
(Fig. 27). Three large iron standards a a a support the ridge
pole h h, and each is fixed by a collar to a flat cruciform plate
<7, which rests on the ground. The connection between the
standards and the ridge-pole is strengthened by four jointed
braces b b b b. Each standard terminates superiorly in a cap c,
mortised to receive the ridge-pole and the rafters, and bearing a
terminal spindle to support the flags. There are five posts
on each side, e e e e e, each resting upon a ground plate g, and
<pb>
each terminating in a wormed spindle. Two bars, each in four
sections, connected by hinged joints ////, unite the side posts,
the spindles of which pass through holes pierced to correspond.
The rafters are the six rods d d d d d d, which are fitted to
mortises in the side posts and the caps c c c of the principal
standards.
The coverin gmay be said to consist of four distinct parts, the
side walls, the end walls, the roof, and the sur-tente.
The side walls are of common sail-cloth (linen), and are pro-

twelve beds.
vided at the lower borders with bands of tarred cloth, six or eight
inches wide; along the upper borders are five leathern straps and
a few strings, by means of which they are fastened to the plates
ffff; the lower borders are secured by pegs driven into the
ground.
The roof is of ordinary canvas, and, stretched over the rafters,
is brought down to the plates and passed over the spindles of the
posts e e e e. The borders of the roof, however, overlap the side
walls quite a foot, and thus close the imperfect joints existing
between the side walls and the plates to which they are
attached.
The end walls, which serve as doors, are simply two pairs of
c c
<pb>
curtains, of material similar to that used in making the roof, and
to which they are tied by a number of strings.
The sur-tente is made of very heavy sail-cloth, which rests
directly upon the roof, and is stretched down and kept in its
place by nine cords attached to pegs in the ground.
The tent is moreover stayed by six storm-ropes, two of which
are attached to each main standard; they are fastened to the
ground by iron pins; eighty additional pins are required to hold
in place the several parts of the tent. At one end of the tent a

small ante-room is made by suspending a second curtain about
four feet from that which serves as the outer door.
The construction is surmounted by three flags, two hospital
flags and the national flag; and its general appearance is very
well shown in the sketch (Fig. 28).
The total weight of the tent is about 440 kilogrammes, or a
little less than a thousand pounds.
Qualities.—These hospital tents are all roomy, may be fairly
well ventilated, and under many circumstances would furnish
excellent quarters for the sick. They all, however, possess several
radical faults. They are too large—indeed their size renders
them wholly unsuitable for campaigning. Their transporta-
tion is always difficult, and frequently impossible, on account of
<pb>
their great weight; while the surface they expose to the wind
when pitched is quite incompatible with security. They are even
much less sturdy than the English marquees. The model at
the Exposition of 1867, although pitched en permanence, with
every precaution, and in a particularly sheltered spot, was quite
a wreck before the close of the season; it had been partly or
wholly blown down a number of times, and its iron framework
twisted and bent into the most inconceivable forms. It would
have been difficult to have furnished a more complete illustration
of the impracticability of issuing to any service in an active army
large house-shaped tents. Although recently these tents have
generally had a second roof or fly, the advantages to be derived
from this, whether as a parasol or a parapluie, have been almost
wholly lost by placing it in close apposition with the first roof.1
An iron framework is most objectionable: it is liable to rust, and
when rusty it soils everything which it touches, it is liable to get
out of order, and when out of order, in the field, can neither be
easily replaced nor repaired.1 The plan of lodging the nurses,
as provided by the Regulation of 1862, is a bad one, aside from
its adding needlessly to the already excessive size of the con-
struction.
A tent employed by the Prussians during the late war is
shown in Fig. 29. It is a small square construction intended to
contain but two beds, and to be used especially for the treat-
ment of those suffering from contagious hospital diseases. It is
supported by a light wooden frame of standards, plates, and
rafters, and is braced with cords attached to pickets. It has a
projecting pyramidal roof, and the covering is made in sections.
It can be opened on all sides, while the curtains, on the two sides
proper, are so constructed as to be rolled up or down as the
occasion may require.
1 "Voitures et Tentes d'Ambulance," par Dr. Thomas W. Evans. Eapport du
Jury International, Paris, 1867.
2 The idea of employing an iron framework appears to have been first put in
practice in Prussia. At least, I find it stated as a novelty in a number of the
"Mechanic's Magazine" for the year 1840, that " the King of Prussia has recently
caused a large tent, supported by an iron framework, to be erected at the camp
in Silesia."
<pb>
Qualities.—This tent is certainly a convenient and excellent
tent, especially for the purpose it was intended to serve, but the
model is evidently too complicated as well as too heavy to be
suitable for campaigning. Although I have no measurements of
this tent, it would appear from the sketch to give a much larger
cubic space to each patient than could be allowed to each patient
generally, without increasing the burden of transportation to a
degree quite impracticable.
The old-fashioned Austrian and Italian "long-tent," in use in
the Austrian service until quite recently, was a wedge-shaped
tent 40 ft. long and 13 ft. high; it weighed 900 lbs., and was in-
tended to shelter fifty soldiers.
 
Fig. 29.—Prussian tent for the treatment of contagious diseases.
A few years since the Austrian Government adopted a form of
tent proposed by Capt. Theurekauf, a sketch of which may be
seen in Fig. 30, and which Major Rhodes describes substantially
as follows :l— It is a large single-poled tent, in length 22 ft.
and in width 26 ft. inside ground measurement. It has tri-
angular-shaped door ends; the top of the triangle from the
ground is 7 ft. 6 in., and its extreme width at the bottom is
12 ft.; the end walls fall perpendicularly. The canvas side walls
are 3 ft. high, and are fastened on the inside by hooks. The tent-
pole is of one piece of wood 4 in. in diameter; its length is 13 ft.
1 Cf. Rhodes, "Tents and Tent Life," pp. 164-167.
<pb>
6 in.; it is inserted into the ground 1 ft., and is there retained
by a block of wood. Eight feet distant on each side of this pole
is placed another pole 3 in. in diameter and 8 ft. 6 in. long, to be
sunk in the ground 1 ft.; a " bread-shelf" rests on the tops of the
short poles. The stay-ropes are fastened to the central pole, and
secured to the "bread-shelf." The doorways are ventilated by
two circular openings.
There are twenty-four small wooden pegs for the walls
and entrances, and eighteen large pegs for extending the
roof. This tent weighs 387f lbs., and costs about 100 dollars.
An officers' tent is used, made after the same general model.
 
Fig. 30.—Captain Theurekaufs Austrian tent.
Qualities.—The tent is roomy, and stands solidly; it is said
never to have been blown down. It has few and short ropes.
The storm-ropes are all on the inside.
But the tissue with which it is covered—hempen canvas—is
loosely woven and quite permeable to rain. It is, moreover, a
single-roofed tent, and its form is not well adapted to the use of
an awning or fly.
Another tent used at the present time in the Austrian army
is known as the "marching tent." In form, it somewhat re-
sembles the French "bonnet de police." It is 18 ft. long, 14 ft.
wide, and a little over 7 ft. high. It is supported by a central
<pb>
pole 7 ft. high, to the top of which a bar, 5$ ft. long, is fastened
in the form of a T. To each extremity of this bar two cords
are attached and pegged to the ground, 9 ft. from the foot of
the central pole. To the top of this pole also two cords are
attached and fastened to the ground, one on each side, and 7 ft.
from its foot. Over the framework of cords the canvas covering
is now thrown, and secured to the ground by wooden pegs. The
tent has a door at each end; it weighs 69| lbs. (English), and
accommodates 10 men.
Qualities.—It will be observed that in this tent, as also in the
one just described, the "weather lines " are on the inside of the
covering—an arrangement which certainly results in some ad-
vantages. The lines support the covering, as well as give
steadiness to the standard, and thus become not only addition-
ally useful, but at the same time cease to interfere with people
in their movements around the tent. The horizontal bar which
forms the ridge is, however, weakly supported, and liable to get
out of order.
In the Austrian army, no tent has been especially provided for
hospital purposes. But the large soldiers' tent is presumed to
furnish ample accommodation for 8 sick, and the "marching
tent" for 2 sick. They are,' however, badly adapted for the
treatment of the sick, as well on account of their forms as the
quality of the material of which the coverings are made.
The tents employed in the Italian army are "shelter-tents,"
"conical tents," and "marquees." No special hospital tent is used.
The shelter-tent is formed of three rectangular sections,
each 1 m. 7 7 in length and 1 m.70 in breadth; they are thus a little
larger than the French sections; they are fabrics of strong linen
canvas—although attempts are now making to employ cotton
tissues for this purpose; the sections weigh a trifle over a kilo-
gramme each. The system of support has already been alluded to.
This tent is furnished to soldiers and non-commissioned officers.
Conical tents are issued to officers; but when the sick are
treated under canvas it is usually in these tents. The Italian
conical tent is a modification of the Turkish " tente conique;" it is
also made of strong white cotton canvas. The upper part of the
tent is doubled with blue canvas. The covering is supported by a
<pb>
central mast, and is retained in place by 44 pegs and pickets. The
tent complete weighs 42 kilogrammes, and costs, according to the
Government estimate, 157'60 francs. It is presumed to be
capable of accommodating five sick persons.
Qualities.—For common field service the Italian conical tent is
greatly superior to those generally used in European armies;
. made of fairly good cotton canvas, it is a comfortable water-proof
tent. It possesses also whatever advantages are special to its form;
but the conical form is not a good one for a hospital tent—it is in
fact a very bad one, and for reasons which have already been
indicated. I may, however, mention in this connection, one ob-
jection applicable to all "bell," "conical," and "circular" tents,
ranging from ten to twenty feet in diameter: the cir-
cular ground plan renders any convenient disposition of the
beds quite impossible. If the tent is small—less than 15 ft.
in diameter—but one or two beds can be put in it; if it is some-
what larger, the centre of the tent is so obstructed as to very
much interfere with the common duties of the attendants.
The marquees have generally been employed by superior
officers—a few have been used for hospital purposes; but this
use was for the most part during or immediately subsequent to
the Crimean War.
The Russian "infantry" tent is 14 ft. square, with side walls
7 ft. high; it is supported by a centre pole and four corner poles.
It is intended to shelter fourteen men, although occupied gene-
rally by a smaller number. The side walls can be raised more
or less completely. The officers' tents differ in no way from the
"infantry" tent, except that their roofs are usually made of
double canvas, or are covered with impermeable rubber cloth.
The Russians have no special hospital tent, but the infantry
tent is roomy, and its form is well adapted for hospital purposes.
It is, however, unprovided with a double roof, and offers too
large a surface to the wind.
In the United States a variety of tents have at different times
been employed—"wall-tents," "bell-tents," "umbrella-tents,"
"wedge-tents," &c. Those most commonly issued to the troops
have been the wedge, the shelter, and the Sibley tents.
The wedge-tent differs in its form in no essential respect from
<pb>
those already described under that name, and represented in the
woodcut on page 322. The United States tent is 6 ft. 10 in.
long, 8 ft. 4 in. broad, 6 ft. 10 in. high, and cubes 194 ft.
It is supported by two standards and a ridge-pole, and is not
stayed by cords. The covering is of common cotton canvas.
The tent is intended to furnish a shelter for five or six men. It
is unprovided with ventilators, is made with but a single entrance
or door-way, and is, as generally constructed, a poor tent for any
purpose.
It should always have a window or two, covered by a flap, or
louvre, placed in the upper part of the roof.
The shelter-tent was issued to the troops during the last years
of the War of the Rebellion, to the exclusion of nearly every
other model.
The United States shelter-tent in form, size, and manner of
support, resembles the French regulation tente-abri. Each man
carries one section (a third of the tent) and a stick. Each sec-
tion is about 6 ft. long by 5 ft. 6 in. broad.
During the War of the Rebellion, however, the sections, in-
stead of having been made of linen canvas, were made of strong
firmly-woven cotton cloth, rendered impermeable by a covering
of caoutchouc. They could thus, if not forming a part of a tent,
be used as blankets on the ground, and often rendered in this
way most excellent services. Moreover, each section had in the
middle a short transverse slit, through which the soldier might
pass his head, and thus use the section in rainy weather as a
cloak (poncho). Each section of an American shelter-tent was
therefore a part of a tent, a water-proof blanket, and a cloak.
The shelter-tent in American camps was frequently pitched in
a way unlike that employed in French camps. Thus two or
three sections of tente-abri were sometimes placed together
side by side, their upper ends fastened to a ridge-pole, and their
lower ends stretched out and pegged to the ground. A screen
was thus made which formed the back and roof of the tent.
The triangular spaces at the two ends were each closed by
another section. The front of the tent was left open; on the
ground before it a fire was built up, the heat from which, re-
flected and concentrated by the roof and sides, as in the old-
<pb>
fashioned kitchen utensil known as a "baker," made this form of
tent very comfortable. These constructions were sometimes
called "baker-tents," "half-faced camps," &c.
I am sorry, however, to feel compelled to destroy the illu-
sion, which doubtless exists in the minds of most Americans
acquainted with army life, that the half-faced camp is a " Yankee
invention." Capt. Marcy certainly speaks of it as "a method
practised a great deal among mountain men" in the far West;1
but many people have discovered, as Capt. Galton has justly
observed,2 that "the main object before sleeping out at night is
to secure a long wind-tight wall, and the next is to obtain a
roof."3 And he afterwards states that a very common means of
accomplishing this object has been thus:—" Support a cross-bar
by two upright standards; against this cross-bar a number of poles
are made to lean; on the back of the poles abundance of fir
branches are laid horizontally; and lastly, on the back of these
are another set of leaning poles, in order to secure them by their
weight."
But the half-faced camp is not even a very modern invention.
The sketches of German camps of the time of Charles V., in
Fronsperger, show numerous examples of such a shelter. Some-
times a square piece of canvas or a blanket was arranged in the
manner I have described, and sometimes the sloping shield was
formed of boards or of poles thatched with straw or some similar
material.4
The Sibley tent is a modified copy of a Comanche lodge. (See
Fig. 31.) This lodge, or wigwam, is made by covering a frame-
work of straight slender poles with skins. Three poles about
twenty feet long are tied together near the top; they are then

<pb>
raised up, and their large ends are planted upon the circumference
of the circle which the lodge is to cover. A sufficient number
of poles are now set up on the same circumference, their tops
dropping into the forks of the first three. The frame is now
covered in, a place being left open for a doorway, above which is
suspended a blanket, that may be drawn down when necessary.
The lodge is also open at the top, or, rather, each side of the
apex is covered with a flap of skin or cloth, that to the wind-
ward being generally propped out by a short pole. A constant
draught is thus maintained, especially when a fire has been built
upon the ground within.
The Sibley modification dispenses with the numerous poles. A
single central mast, resting upon an iron tripod, supports the
covering, which is of cotton canvas. The tent has the form of a
cone, is about 13 ft. high, and has a diameter at its base of 18 ft. It
cubes 1,102 ft., and will shelter comfortably twelve or fourteen men.
There is a large open-
ing at its apex, over
which is a hood which
can be raised or closed
at the sides by cords
that hang down with-
in the tent. The cover-
ing is supported solely
by the mast and the
pegs which fasten it
directly to the ground. When the doorway is closed, the canvas
overlaps within and without. (See Fig. 32.)
The Sibley tent cost in 1861 63-71 dollars (gold.) It has since
ceased to be an article
of equipment in the
United States army.
Although originally in-
tended to serve as a
troop-tent, the Sibley
was occasionally used
as a shelter for the
Fio. 32.—-A Sibley tent. sick.
 
Fig. 31.—A Comanche lodge.
<pb>
Qualities.—The Sibley is one of the best conical tents with
which I am acquainted. The material of which it is made is
fairly impermeable, it stands firmly, and its elongated form gives
more headroom than is usually found in conical tents. Ventilation
is also well assured. The objections to its use, as a shelter for
the sick, are its form, and the absence of a second roof, which if
not absolutely necessary to keep the rain out, would—could it
be applied—make it far more comfortable, particularly in
the summer, as its walls cannot be easily raised.
The wall-tent used by the United States Government as a
hospital tent is thus officially described :—" Hospital tents must
in future be made according to the pattern of the present tent,
and of the same material, but smaller, and having on one end a
lapel, so as to admit of two or more tents being joined and thrown
into one with a continuous covering or roof. The dimensions to
be these: In length 14 ft., in width 15 ft., in height (centre)
11 ft., with a wall 4 ft. 6 in., and a 'fly' of appropriate
size. The ridge-pole to be made in two sections after the .present
pattern, and to measure 14 ft. when joined. Such a tent will
accommodate from eight to ten patients comfortably."1 As this
description may be considered scarcely satisfactory, at least by
one unacquainted with the "pattern of the present tent," I shall
furnish some additional details. The tent, like the old French
"cortine" is shaped like a "small house;" it is nearly square,
with vertical ends, and with vertical side walls; its roof has a
double and quite steep pitch. It is supported within by two
perpendicular poles, 12 ft. long, to be sunk in the ground a foot,
and united together by a ridge-pole, which, notwithstanding the
"official" statement, is generally a single pole. When pitched,
the canvas is stretched into position by fourteen cords, each 8 ft.
long, attached to wooden pickets or pegs; the side walls are
fastened at the bottom each by seven pegs, and each vertical
end wall by five. Two storm-ropes attached to the tops of the
upright poles secure the tent. Over the tent is thrown a sur-
tente, or "fly," overlapping about a foot the angle formed on
each side by the roof and wall of the tent.

wo
ON TENTS AND
To be still more specific, I should say that the poles are made
of light, strong wood (ash or cedar); the standards terminate
at each superior extremity in an iron spindle, intended to pass
through holes corresponding at the ends of the ridge-pole.
When the ridge-pole has been attached in the way indicated
to the standards, the framework is completed. It will be
observed, however, that the iron spindles project through the
ridge-pole three or four inches. The covering which forms the
tent proper having been laid upon the ground and unrolled upon
its side, this framework is passed within it, and the spindles are
pushed through two small holes, which will be found at the
upper and outer angles of the covering. The large square piece
of canvas which will be discovered rolled up with the tent is the
"fly," or second roof. Upon examining it, two holes will be
found in it, each one in the middle of an outer border. Suppose
the tent to be lying flat upon the ground, and the framework to
have been properly introduced. The fly may now be drawn
under it until the hole in each border reaches the corresponding
spindle, over this it is slipped, when the outer half of the fly
is brought forwards over the ridge-pole, enveloping it, as well
as the tent. Two places having been properly prepared in the
ground, into which to sink the standards, the tent is raised, and
a few pickets having been driven into the ground, it may be
temporarily stayed by slipping over their heads the nooses of the
bracing cords. The pickets are afterwards permanently placed
at such a distance as shall permit the tent being drawn out so as
to cover a rectangular ground surface 15 ft. wide. The side and
end walls are then pegged to the ground; and the fourteen cords
of the fly may be attached to the fourteen lateral tent pickets,
iouble-notched for the purpose, or to fourteen pegs, seven of
which are driven into the ground on each side, and a little be-
yond those which secure the tent. The fly is supported by the
ridge-pole, but it nowhere in its descent touches the roof of
the tent, and is separated from it at the angles of the roof and
the side walls about 10 in.
I may here call attention to the way in which the cords are
attached to the pickets. The cords, 8 ft. in length, are doubled
upon themselves, forming long nooses; these are simply dropped
<pb>
over the heads of the pickets. The tent is stretched out by
pulling upon that part of the noose which forms the short part of
the cord, and which, passing through one end of a small oblong
piece of wood, terminates in a knot; the long part of the cord
passes through a hole in the other end of the same piece of
wood; this piece of wood completes the noose. When held at
right angles to the cords, the long cord slides freely through it,
but its tendency when left to itself is to assume a position
parallel with the cords, thus locking the noose firmly. As all
tents are more or less loosened or tightened by the hygrometric
state of the atmosphere, this simple contrivance for securely
holding and tightening and loosening the tent, as the occasion
may require, is most convenient. The way in which the key
acts will be at once understood by referring to Plate IX.
(Appendix).
Doorways 8 ft. high are cut in each vertical end of the tent,
and are closed by overlapping canvas secured by strings. The
covering is made of cotton canvas (duck) firmly woven, which
weighs 14 oz. to the yard (28 in. wide). The tent proper con-
tains about 74 square yards of canvas, and therefore weighs,
when made of 14-oz. canvas, 83 lbs. 4 oz.; the fly contains
about 32 square yards of canvas, and weighs 36 lbs., thus giving
a total of about 120 lbs., exclusive of poles, pins, and cords, the
weight of which may be estimated at about 35 lbs.; the complete
tent therefore weighs about 155 lbs. Such a tent complete cost,
in New York, in 1870, 100 dollars currency. But the cost, as
well as the weight of the tent, are considerably reduced by using
lighter grades of duck; and this is sometimes done, although the
advantages are perhaps more than counterbalanced by the faults
special to inferior materials.
Qualities.—The tent has a good form; it is roomy, and there
is no lost space in it. It has the proper size for a field tent;
it is perfectly transportable; a pack mule can carry one with
the poles and pickets. It does not offer so large a side surface
to the wind as to be easily blown down. Whoever may have
designed this tent, evidently proposed a practical compromise
between a desirable roominess and a desirable steadiness.
Shorten the side,walls and the tent will stand more firmly, but
<pb>
its interior will be more inconvenient; whatever may be added to
their height makes the tent more roomy, but at the same time
it weakens its power to resist storms. As a campaigning hos-
pital tent, I believe that nothing could really be gained by alter-
ing in any way either its form or size. The pitch of its roof is
sufficient to shed water well, but its impenetrability to wet—one
of its principal excellences—is to a great extent a property of
the tissue of which it is made. A piece of firmly woven cotton
canvas is water-tight; rain collected in its folds will not filter
through even slowly; it does not tamise except when the rain
beats with the greatest violence, and even then but slightly.
But the superiority of the American hospital tent depends largely
upon its outer roof. I have already, when speaking of the
marquee, had occasion to mention some of the advantages of a
second covering or roof, and I have elsewhere said that no
hospital tent should be unprovided with such a roof. It is a
protection against rain and dew, and is a protection against the
direct heat of the sun. These are obviously important consi-
derations. By sheltering the tent beneath from rain and wet,
the outer roof also accomplishes indirectly an object of great
importance. Air passes through wet canvas with difficulty.
The air, consequently, within a damp, wet tent, becomes impure
much more speedily than when the canvas is dry. Moreover,
the canvas when wet attaches to itself a much larger proportion
of organic molecular matter—in short, becomes more speedily
infected—than when dry. A large fly, therefore, by keeping the
tent beneath it dry, assists in maintaining the purity of the air
within the tent. In this connection I may mention an advantage
it possesses over the outer covering of the marquee. This outer
covering protects the inner tent from becoming wet; but it
becomes itself, especially when wet, a great obstacle to the
circulation of air, hence the frequent complaints of the heat and
mustiness of the air shut in between the walls of the marquee.
The fly, on the other hand, while protecting the tent from wet
and dew, obstructs in no way the exit of the air from within.
As a parasol, also, the fly is greatly superior to the outer tent of
the marquee, and for the same reason, since it allows the air to
be constantly swept from beneath it. The American tent stands
<pb>
in the shade of its fly, which constantly catching the wind, and
flapping and drawing as would a sail, encourages an active cir-
culation of air between itself and the tent. Admitting that the
principal use of the fly, as also of the outer covering of the
marquee, is to protect the tent beneath or within from rain, and
that the ventilation of a marquee may be made as complete as is
desirable, an advantage which will always rest incontestably with
the fly is this: containing less than one-half the number of square
yards of canvas entering into the tent itself, it covers and
completely protects against rain more than half of the tent.
To cover a tent completely by an outer covering, as is done
in the English marquee, requires nearly double the number
of yards of canvas necessary to make the tent itself. To state
the principle generally: the American fly at one-fourth of the
expense gives nearly or quite three-fourths of the shelter obtained
by the outer tent of the English marquee.
As the question whether a field hospital tent should be pro-
tected simply by a fly, or covered entirely by an outer tent, is
really an important one, I wish to discuss it with the most
perfect fairness. A tent completely covered by another tent is
certainly better protected against the wind, and is warmer than a
tent placed under a fly. This is a fact about which there can be
no doubt. I may remark, however, that when an outer covering
is used, the warmth of the inner tent is only obtained by inter-
fering with its natural ventilation, and that the evil resulting
from this interference probably often quite compensates for the
particular advantage referred to.
As a rule men within tents are much more likely to suffer from
excessive heat than from excessive cold; and unless it could be
shown that single canvas tents were necessarily uncomfortable
except when placed inside of other tents, I should object to such
a procedure for the reasons already given. I shall show else-
where how single canvas tents can be kept sufficiently and com-
fortably warm during the winter in temperate climates. But I
may observe here, without reference to any system of heating,
that if it is considered of such paramount importance to be able
to say, this or that tent is warmer than other tents, it would be well
if the constructors of such warm tents paid a little more attention
<pb>
to the materials of which their tents are made—at least, before
attempting to make them warmer by means which are objection-
able in principle, besides being enormously costly, especially
when we consider the small positive advantage usually gained.
It should be particularly observed that the fly is not simply
an outer roof. It is a roof disposed in a particular manner, with
a free, clear interval between it and the roof of the tent itself.
This is a most important point; it involves well-known principles
which are represented in the umbrel]a and parasol. A thin tissue
stretched out overhead may serve as a very effective protection
alike against rain and the rays of the sun. If the same tissue
were applied directly to the body, it would be found to have
lost nearly all its special powers of protection. Simple and
evident as are the principles involved, they have been more than
once overlooked by the constructors of tents; and one of the
most remarkable and singular instances of such an oversight is
to be seen in the new Prussian regulation hospital tent.
A large fly, one which projects well over the sides of the tent,
and applied, as I have explained, so as to leave a free space open
to the wind between itself and the tent, protects a tent admirably
both as an umbrella and as a sun-shade.
But the fly is often of great value for another purpose; it may
be used, whenever the season permits or occasion requires, as a
supplementary or independent tent. If it be desired to increase
the capacity of the tent, the fly is simply brought forward, the
hole in its posterior edge slipped over the spindle in the top of
the first standard, a new ridge pole and standard improvised,
and the fly itself stretched out on either side; it now forms a
most convenient awning or verandah in front of the tent.
If tents be wanting where flys are used, a series of large
wedge-tents may be at any time extemporised;—and I may add
that this was done again and again during the War of the Rebel-
lion, not so much because of the want of tents, as because the fly
alone seemed to furnish all the shelter required. Another advan-
tage possessed by this American tent is of such great import-
ance, that I am surprised it has been so universally over-
looked by those who may have in times past interested them-
selves in tent architecture. In accordance with the official regu-
<pb>
lation:—" It must have on one end a lapel, so as to admit of two or
more tents being joined and thrown into one, with a continuous
covering or roof." In a word, each American hospital tent,
while complete within itself, is a component part of a large tent or
pavilion, the size of which may be determined at will. Generally
in the establishment of field hospitals four or six of these tents are
united together, so as to form a long pavilion; the doors are thrown
open between them, and the vertical walls which separate the
tents are rolled back on either side; a long ward is thus formed,
each tent opening freely into the one adjoining. The general
advantages of this practice are great. First,—the sick are more
easily and better taken care of in a large open ward than when
they are isolated, and it is necessary to visit them from tent to
tent ; secondly,—they are less exposed to draughts of air from
the constant opening of the doors; thirdly,—they are more com-
pletely sheltered, the tents protecting each other; fourthly,—
the tents stand more solidly; fifthly,—the tents are more easily
and economically warmed ; sixthly,—the ground space of the
camp is economized.
Conical and pyramidal tents cannot be thus united; and if it
were said either of the Prussian tent, or the English marquee,
that it is large enough for any hospital tent, my reply would be,
admitting this to be true—while large enough to be conveniently
spacious within, they are each so large and heavy, that the dif-
ficulty of transporting a single tent is a constant source of incon-
venience as well as of misfortune. The American tent, it will be
seen, is at the same time small and large; small, whenever it may
be necessary to transport it, and, when pitched, as large as one may
choose to make it. I believe the American tent to be the most
valuable model yet offered for the hospitalization of troops in
the field; an opinion which, expressed by me in 1867, when a
delegate to the Conference of the International Societe de Secours
aux Blesses, I had the satisfaction of seeing sustained almost
unanimously by the members of that Conference.1 I believe
that both in size, and form, and disposition, it is better fitted than
any other model with which I am acquainted to serve in the field

<pb>
as the unit of a simple and efficient system of tent hospitalization.
I do not wish to say that I believe this tent is perfect—it can
most undoubtedly be improved. The extent of such improve-
ments, however, must be largely a matter of opinion, depending
on the relative importance attached to the realization of the con-
ditions desirable in a hospital tent. I have already said that,
however desirable it may be to increase the height of the side
walls, this cannot be done without diminishing the sturdi-
ness of the tent; and several of its faults are similar in this
respect, that any attempt to remedy them would be quite certain
to result only in the substitution of one fault for another. I
believe the chief defect in the American hospital tent is the
absence of suitable provisions for its ventilation; as now made,
the only direct method of renewing the air within it is by open-
ing the doors and raising the side walls, both of which pro-
cedures are objectionable in the winter, and may be at any
season of the year. They besides assure no regularity in the
supply of air; this at one time may be excessive, and at
another, particularly at night, is likely to be quite shut off. Two
or three openings near the ridge ought to be cut in each tent;
these should be covered with a flap to which a short prop is
attached—the extremity of which may be inserted in a pocket
fastened to the lower edge of the opening, whenever it may be de-
sirable to open one of the apertures. I may add that the tents used
at the American ambulance were all thus furnished with ridge
ventilators. The objection to its straggling cords is one applic-
able not only to it, but to all wall-tents. Unlike most, however,
the American tent is amenable to treatment with regard to this evil.
As the tent is stayed out at the sides alone,1 the pickets may be
replaced on each side by a bar placed parallel with the angle
formed by the roof and side walls, on a level with it, and but a
few inches from it. To this bar the stay-ropes may be tied; the
space in front of the tent, as also that in the rear, thus remains
open. Whenever it is probable that a tent may remain for some
time on the same ground, if possible, this is the best way to pitch
it, as, while avoiding the inconvenience of the cords and econo-
1 Practically, the storm-ropes of this tent are seldom used.
<pb>
mizing the ground surface, the tent itself is rendered much more
secure than when held only by pickets.
In the summer of 1867 I had the opportunity of directing the
attention of a number of scientific gentlemen to the excellences of
the American tents exhibited by Dr. Thomas W. Evans, at the
Exposition Universelle, and forming a part of his remarkable
"sanitary collection." Among these gentlemen was Professor
Le Fort of Paris, who then expressed without hesitation his
belief that the best results might often be obtained by treating
the wounded under canvas. A year or two afterwards he pro-

posed a tent which has many merits; a description of it I shall
here give, and in his own words.
Le Forfs Tent.—" By a special arrangement, I have been able
to get up a model free from the inconveniences belonging to the
American tent. The arrangement consists in the employment of
a compass offering a point cCappui, to form the roof, and serving
at the same time to establish and permanently maintain the
separation of the two coverings.
"The skeleton of the tent is composed of two upright poles
united at the summits by a horizontal bar slipped through a
sheath made in the first roof. The two coverings descend
parallelly, (as may be seen in Figure 33,) to the edge of the
roof, they then reach the ground, where they are fastened by a
few pickets. The vertical walls corresponding to the gables are
also formed of double canvas, and are each pierced with a double
<pb>
door, which is opened by rolling up the canvas on itself, and
fixing it by a couple of straps. The outer roof has on each side,
on a level with the ridge, three whistle-shaped windows; the
inner roof is pierced on the same level with a considerable num-
ber of openings. The circulation of air between the two cover-
ings and the interior of the tent is very complete, guarantees
against any elevation of temperature, and assures a constant
and active aeration, especially when the doors are open. The
compass is formed of two wooden poles joined at the centre upon
a metallic cylinder, which slides freely along the length of the
vertical support. The free extremity of each limb of the compass
terminates in an iron spindle provided with a screw point and a
couple of nuts. This spindle passes through holes pierced in the
border of the canvas on a level with the inferior angle of the
roof; the interior covering rests upon the shoulder formed by the
extremity of the wooden pole; the exterior covering rests upon
a nut screwed down twenty or twenty-five centimetres upon the
metallic spindle; the second nut, not shown in the design, and
which, moreover, is not indispensable, prevents the covering from
slipping off' the compass. The borders of the two coverings, from
the ridge to the ground, are bolt-roped, as are sails; these ropes,
attached to pickets, assure the solidity of the tent, for they are
more or less put upon the stretch, according as in lifting up the
centre of the compass the free extremities of the limbs are
separated. Another cord runs horizontally from one end of the
tent to the other, fixing and marking the edge of the roof.
That of the outer roof terminates in a free end, to be attached to
a picket sunk in the ground; it steadies the roof, and prevents
the distortion of the compass by the tension of the canvass. It
may be observed en passant, and without entering into de-
tails, that a few girths sewed on to the canvas may be used to
advantage in place of the bolt-ropes, which are greatly affected
by the hygrometric state of the air. Besides the two doors
placed in each end, a wide door opening as an awning is cut in the
sides, which form the lateral walls.
"A very simple modification, and one which neither increases
the cost of construction nor the difficulty of installation,
allows a disposition to be given to the tent shown in the
<pb>
following sketch (Fig. 34)—an arrangement by means of which
the patient can be placed in the open air during the heat of
the day, without being exposed to the rays of the sun. It
is only necessary to divide the interior covering into two
parts, one of which shall form the roof, the other the lateral
walls; these walls are made to slide as curtains upon a horizontal
cord, running from one end of the tent to the other and attached
to the braces; they may be thus gathered in towards the angles.
An inspection of the designs will enable one readily to understand
the advantages this ambulance tent, which we have used the
past season, has over the American tent. The clear space (and
 
Fig. 34.—M. Le FortVfield hospital tent as modified by himself.
consequently the quantity of air allowed to each patient) is
greatly augmented by reason of the vertical walls; far from
being obliged to stoop on approaching the beds, one may go into
any part of the tent, even with his hat on, without hitting the
roof anywhere.
"The circulation of air, as well between the coverings as within
the tent itself, is as complete as one could wish, and it may be
increased or diminished according to the state of the weather.
"The hygrometric state of the atmosphere incessantly modifies
the tension of the coverings. Raising or depressing the compass
suffices to remedy these modifications; nothing of the sort is
possible in the American tent.1 The canvas being double at

p. 391 were designed to correct, so far as there was any necessity for doing so, the
<pb>
every point, the sick are much more completely protected, as
well against the heat of the day as against the cold during the night.
"The ambulance tent which we have proposed measures five
metres on each side; that is to say, it covers a superficies of
twenty-five square metres. It can receive without being over-
crowded six beds, with an interval of a metre between each; and
the cubage to be allowed to each patient is not to be estimated
in a hospital under canvas as in an ordinary hospital. Each tent
made by the house Husson, of canvas ' hystasaspes,'1 costs about
800 francs. The cost amounts, therefore, to 133 francs per
bed. The weight of the tent is a little over 100 kilogrammes
(220 lbs.). By uniting together end to end several of these
tents, wards may be made for ten, fifteen, twenty, or more sick.
The wards will communicate by the doors in the vertical ends, or
they may be divided into separate sections by closing the doors.
To hold the tents together, all it is necessary to do is to place a
clamp pierced with two holes over the spindles of the two free
and contiguous branches of the compass."2
At the commencement of the late war a considerable number
of tents were made by the house Husson for the French " Soctete'
de Secours aux Blesses," and several kindred associations. Con-
effects of the atmosphere referred to. Indeed, M. Le Fort himself seems to have
partly recognized the object of the keys, as more recently he has said (" La Chirurgie
Militaire," p. 173) :—" The American tent requires an extravagance—(un veritable
luxe)—of stay-ropes, and these ropes must be constantly manipulated in tightening
and loosening the canvas according to the constantly varying hygrometric state of
the atmosphere."
As experience is always worth more than a theoretical opinion, I may remark that
during the six months our tents were pitched at the American ambulance I never
had occasion myself, nor did I ever see anyone attempt, to tighten or loosen the cords.
I do not say this was never done, I only wish to say that tightening and loosening
were seldom required, and that loosening was rarely if ever required, on account
of the immediate shrinking of the canvas from wet, even when coming in the form
of rain. The shrinkage of cotton stuffs from wet is slight.
The English marquee requires eighty-two stay-ropes. If the twenty-eight or
thirty ropes of the American tent are for M. Le Fort positively, un veritable luxe, I
am a little curious to know what may be his comparatives and superlatives.
1 This name is given by the house Husson to canvas which has been prepared by
having been passed through a solution of sulphate of copper, &c. The process is
covered by a patent.

<pb>
structed nominally in accordance with the plan proposed by
M. Le Fort, they differed in certain respects, as the accom-
panying sketch will show (Fig. 35). The tents were united
together end to end; they were destitute of a double roof, and
the quality of the canvas made of flax was so inferior to that used
by M. Le Fort in the construction of his own tents, as to greatly
invalidate the conclusions drawn from their experimental use.
Qualities.—The tent originally proposed by M. Le Fort is an
excellent one; it not only has a double roof, but it has double

"Society de Secours aux Blesses" in 1870.
sides; it is roomy and impermeable. As regards ventilation it
could scarcely have been made more perfect. It has, however,
in my opinion, several defects—and in making this statement
let me say, that it would be impossible to make a tent which
should not have defects; it will necessarily be more or less per-
fect in some respects, and more or less imperfect in others;
it will be found that certain desirable qualities cannot be
secured without sacrificing others of almost equal importance,
or which, if not really so, may seem to other constructors of tents
of equal or even greater importance. The best tent, as the best
<pb>
instrument of any kind, is the one in which the excellences
greatly overbalance the faults—is best, if you will permit me to
say it, in spite of its faults. But I am now to speak of the defects
of M. Le Fort's tent. Its framework is too complicated, each tent
is supported by seven poles, and four of these axe jointed—that is
to say, liable to break, get out of order, and become useless. It
should also be said that to reduce their weight all the poles have
been made so slender as to be easily bent out of straight lines, as
also to be in constant danger of breakage. The material of which
the covering is made is cotton stuff of a good quality; to make it,
however, according to M. Le Fort, still more impermeable (fairly
good cotton canvas requires the application of nothing to make
it impervious to wet), it has been steeped in a solution of sulphate
of copper. The tissue charged with sulphate of copper, if theoreti-
cally less pervious to rain, unfortunately becomes to the same
degree less pervious to air. M. Le Fort might reply that the
measures which he has taken to secure the aeration of his tent are
sufficient to allow him to shut up the pores of the canvas, should
he choose to do so. If such is the fact, it would perhaps have been
better to have applied to the canvas a coating of caoutchouc, or some
other substance which would have given to it complete imperme-
ability. The superiority of good cotton canvas when used as a tent
covering depends upon its possessing the two invaluable qualities
of impermeability to wet and permeability to air. The only motive
which can justify the application of any preparation to a cotton
canvas tent covering, is the desire to give to it increased durability.
Should the canvas hystasaspes prove to be considerably more dur-
able than unprotected tissues, the objection now offered to its
employment could scarcely be maintained. The Le Fort tent
stands by no means securely; it relatively offers to the wind a sur-
face greater than that of an English marquee, and this, without
either bracing-lines or storm-ropes; in a word, it is a fair weather
tent. Entertaining the idea that the American tent could be
improved, M. Le Fort has certainly succeeded in realizing
his idea, in so far as he may have produced a tent roomier and
more accessible to the open air. He has, I believe, however, failed,
in so far as his tent is much heavier, much more costly, less
secure when pitched, and more likely to get out of order.
<pb>
S will have been observed, the coverings of modern tents
have been made of quite a variety of strong, heavy tissues
of hemp, flax, or cotton, or of these materials mixed; such
tissues also have occasionally been especially prepared by the
application of certain substances to insure greater imperme-
ability or durability.1
There is but one kind of canvas now employed by the French
Government in the fabrication of tents—tentes coniques, and sacs
tentes-abris. The tissue is made of Picardy or Belgian flax; it
is known as toile trots fils—of three threads—and should weigh
500 grammes per metre of 80 centimetres breadth. The Govern-
ment, however, recognizes a minimum weight of 400 grammes
per metre; and it may be here remarked that the hygrometric
properties of flax cause all coarse unbleached tissues made from
it to vary quite 20 per cent. in weight, according to the amount
of humidity present in the atmosphere.
A piece of French regulation canvas 4 centimetres square,
and containing 16 square centimetres, is composed of 120
threads (maximum), 70 of warp and 60 of woof; as the threads of
the warp are double, the total number of threads is 200. The
two threads of the warp are parallel (untwisted), and each of the
two rather heavier and more firmly twisted than the woof thread.
The threads, however, of both warp and woof are wanting in
regularity.
According to the official specifications, a square centimetre of
this canvas must contain 32 or 33 warp threads and 14 or 15
woof threads. The tissue must respond also to a dynamometrical
test—viz., a strip 40 centimetres long and 5 centimetres broad
should sustain a weight of 240 kilogrammes in the direction of the
1 Tent coverings have also occasionally been made of wool, or of cotton and wool
mixed. I am not aware, however, if such tissues have ever been employed by Govern-
ments to an extent worthy of note. Whatever the special excellence of such coverings,
their high cost must always be an obstacle to any very extended use.
<pb>
warp, and a weight of 160 kilogrammes in the direction of the
weft. French tent canvas is pliable, but feels rather harsh to the
touch; its colour is a dark brown, the natural colour of the flax.
Hemp has occasionally been used in the fabrication of French
tent coverings,—"but only exceptionally; the high price of the
best qualities of the material which it would be indispensable to
select for this purpose, the great difficulties to be overcome in
weaving—dans le tissage a sec—a thread No. 16, regular and
free from knots, so as to arrive at the production of a tissue well
closed and uniform, the waste attending the different processes
of manufacture, are so many causes which have determined the
Government to prefer flax to hemp in the fabrication of tent
coverings." These reasons seem to have had no less weight with
other Governments, as hemp is at the present time rarely em-
ployed in Europe in the fabrication of tent canvas.
English (Government) tent canvas is now made of the "best
long Baltic flax;" it weighs 10^ oz. to the yard (27 in. wide),
and, although lighter, is more closely woven than the French
canvas. The thread also is finer, more uniform, and of a clearer
colour than the French thread, and the quality of the tissue
is apparently superior to that used in France. The quality of
the canvas is determined by its weight, the number of threads in
a square inch, and its general appearance, but no strength test is
used.
Austrian (Government) tent canvas is made of flax-thread
No. 16 and No. 10, and weighs 20f loths (306 grammes) per
metre, of the breadth of a Vienna ell (78 centimetres). The
tissue must contain nineteen threads (weft) in each quarter of a
square inch, and is, moreover, subjected to a dynamometrical
test.
The flax tissues used for tent coverings in different countries
vary considerably in weight, strength, fineness, colour, &c.; they
all possess, however, certain common characteristics. The linen
fibre is about 2^c>o °f an mcn m diameter, is cylindrical, with
little knots or swellings at intervals; it is roughened also by the
frayed and partly detached elementary fibres composing it; it is
hard and strong, although perhaps not harder than the cotton
fibre.
<pb>
Linen, as well as hemp threads, are hard and stiff, not regular,
smooth upon their surfaces, and inelastic. The meshes between
the threads are seldom perfectly closed, as may be seen by look-
ing at almost any piece of linen canvas held up before a window.
By examining the canvas more closely with a lens, the threads
may be seen crossing each other like wires, or, rather, like
sinewy cords of catgut, leaving distinct interspaces at each
crossing.
There are several qualities of cotton canvas used by the United
States Government for making tents; these are commonly dis-"
tinguishedas 8-oz., 10-oz., 12-oz., and 14-oz. "ducks," the specifi-
cation being derived from the weight of the tissue per yard of 28 in.
width. While the 8-oz. and 10-oz. ducks are used for making
common tent coverings, hospital tents are generally made of
12-oz. or 14-oz. ducks.
A piece of American 14-oz. duck 4 centimetres square, con-
taining 16 square centimetres, is composed of 125 threads,
75 of warp and 50 of woof; but the warp threads are each
formed of three distinct threads, and the woof threads of two
distinct threads; thus the total number of threads in such a
piece is 325. A square yard weighs about 18 oz., or -j^yoz. more
than an equal measure of French canvas—a difference equiva-
lent to about 4 per cent. When the cotton threads are un-
ravelled, they look considerably larger than the flax threads of
the French tissue, on account of their greater elasticity; the
result is that, although a square yard of 14-oz. cotton duck
weighs but a trifle more than an equal measure of French regula-
tion tent canvas, it seems to have considerably more body than
the French canvas.
American duck is pliable, smooth to the touch, and, when
new, has the colour of common unbleached manufactured cotton;
its whiteness is never dazzling, and, after a little exposure, it
assumes a drab colour. Its quality is determined by its weight
and the number of threads in a square inch. No dynamo-
metrical test is employed.
Cotton canvas is no longer used in the British army for tents.
That formerly employed weighed 7 oz. to the yard, 27 in.
wide.
<pb>
The Italian Government employs cotton canvas almost ex-
clusively for the construction of large tents. The tissue used is
75 centimetres broad, and weighs 245 grammes per metre—that
is to say, about 1\ oz. to the yard, 28 in. wide.
The several varieties of cotton canvas which I have mentioned
resemble each other in certain essential respects. The fibres of
cotton vary, according to the quality of the sample, from xxhsa
to fTjfrjs of an inch in diameter, and appear, under the microscope,
like flat twisted ribands; they are smooth, have a certain strength,
and are very hard. Cotton thread is very regular, is pliable
and elastic, and has a soft downy surface. These qualities of the
thread make it easy to fabricate tissues quite free from visible
meshes. Indeed, under a lens it will be difficult to find an
open mesh in a good piece of American duck. American canvas
is probably not woven as closely in the loom as French canvas,
but the meshes will be found to have been packed with minute
fibres pushed in and constantly held in place by the elasticity of
the threads.
Very widely different opinions are entertained at the present
time with reference to the respective merits of cotton and linen
tent coverings. I presume, however, that few persons would
venture to affirm that cotton tissues were inferior to linen tissues
for tent coverings per se,—at least, the argument in favour of
using linen is usually expressed by a single word—cheapness.
Coarse linen tissues have generally been thought to be more
durable than those of cotton, while at the same time they have
commonly been offered in the market at a smaller first cost.
These points are of sufficient importance to be considered;
and if we find that the durability of such linen stuffs is very
much greater than that possessed by corresponding cotton stuffs,
and that their first cost is, as a rule, very much less, we shall
certainly have to admit the justice of the argument, unless we
can finally prove that the use of linen canvas is attended with
disadvantages which are at least an equivalent for its relative
cheapness.
I believe, however, that the durability and cheapness of linen
tissues, as compared with corresponding cotton fabrics, have been
commonly greatly over-estimated. The destructive influences to
<pb>
which canvas is exposed when made into tents are various and nu-
merous; and although linen may wear better under special circum-
stances than cotton, under others it is certainly no more durable.
It may be summarily said that tents are destroyed—(1) by
the wear of actual use; (2) by the wear and tear of transporta-
tion; (3) by exposure to the weather; (4) by mildew ; (5)
by a variety of accidents to which they are exposed, such as
being torn by bodies pushed against them from within or without,
"sparks of fire from camp fires and stoves," &c., &c.
With regard to such wear as comes from ordinary use and
handling, cotton fabrics are not inferior to linen. If linen fabrics
are believed to wear better than those of cotton it is usually only
an a priori conclusion from the well-known fact that linen fabrics
are, when new, much stronger—that is to say, can resist, without
being rent, a greater tractive force than similar cotton fabrics. But
it is not altogether easy to ascertain the relative strength of flax
and cotton fibres, or of flax and cotton threads', the strength—
tenacity—of these threads depending greatly upon the relative
amount of twisting they receive ; and cotton usually requires
more twisting than flax to develop a corresponding degree of
tenacity, as the flax fibres are long and knotty, and conse-
quently hold together better. One fact is certain: American
14-oz. duck, when new, will by no means respond to the French
dynamometrical test.
In reply to a question, concerning the relative durability of
cotton and linen sails, addressed to an American «ail-maker of
large experience, I received this answer:—" Cotton sails generally
wear three years; after this time they are not to be depended
upon. Linen sails generally wear two years, with more mending
than cotton. Linen sails grow thin by wear. After a time
cotton sails grow weak, but they do not grow thin by wear."
This statement is not surprising, for although linen canvas when
new is stronger than cotton canvas, its inelasticity and hardness
cause it to wear out much faster when subjected to the same use.
Linen canvas becomes with use both thinner and lighter; cotton
canvas grows lighter with wear, but it does not become in the
same proportion thin, on account of the elasticity of its constituent
fibres. "A fibre," says M. Alcan, "of a given strength, but
<pb>
without elasticity, would be much less suitable for making thread
or cloth than one of less strength but sensibly elastic. This last
property, although less generally appreciated than the first, is
therefore quite as useful." 1 The hardness and stiffness of linen
and hemp tissues are particularly noticeable when they are wet or
even damp. A small piece of French tent canvas, if immersed
in water, will curl up like a piece of leather when heated, and its
hard, horny surface then greatly exposes it to wear from friction.
And I may here remark that it is a well-known fact of common
experience that linen articles of apparel will not stand frequent
washings better than similar cotton articles. The smooth fibres
of cotton slip over each other easily, the knotty and gummy fibres
of flax and hemp slide over each other with more difficulty, with
more friction and more wear.
With regard, therefore, to two of the principal causes of the
destruction of tents—the wear of actual use and the wear result-
ing from transportation—I presume there is very little, if any,
ground for preferring flax to cotton as the material from which to
make tent coverings.
Probably the principal cause of the destruction of tents is
their liability to become damaged by exposure to the weather.
Such damage is shown by a loss of strength in the tissue which,
without losing substance, grows weak, and becomes, as it is
popularly expressed, rotten. This condition is so directly con-
nected, however, with one of the specific causes of the destruction
of tents—mildew—as to be hardly separable from it.
To what extent tissues of cotton are more or less exposed than
those of linen to "rot" and mildew, it is not altogether easy
to decide, in the absence of careful comparative experiments, which
alone can definitively settle the point in question. One fact is cer-
tain, that especially in damp, hot, coast climates, unless great care
is taken, tents both of linen and of cotton are liable to become
mouldy, and are perhaps more frequently condemned on account «
of being rotten than because unserviceable from actual wear.
I doubt, however, if there is generally much difference in the
1 "Traite Complet de la Filature du Coton," par M. Alcan.
Paris, 1865 ; p. 72.
<pb>
durability of linen and cotton tents -when both are pitched per-
manently and exposed only to the destructive influences of the
weather. The common opinion among the French fournisseurs
whom I have consulted has been, that a regulation French tent
(tente conique) should last, if pitched permanently in such a
climate as that of Paris, two or three years. In reply to the
question addressed to the English War Office:—"How long might
an English hospital marquee be expected to remain serviceable if,
pitched permanently, it was exposed only to the destructive
influences of the weather—say in such a climate as that of
Aldershot (England)?" the reply was, "Eighteen months."
To a similar question, the reply received from the Surgeon-
General's Office at Washington was as follows:—" A tent of
cotton canvas, if pitched permanently, and exposed only to the
destructive influences of the weather, in such a climate as that of
Washington, could not be expected to remain serviceable more
than three years." To a similar question, the Italian War
Office replied generally:—" There is no doubt that these tents
(of cotton canvas) thus exposed would remain for a long time
in a satisfactory condition. The average service life of a tent
(tente conique) is four years." To a like question the French
Intendance also replied generally:—" The present tente conique
cannot be used more than four months without undergoing
repairs. This four months' lastingness would doubtless be
sensibly reduced if the tent were subject to numerous trans-
portations and repitchings. Three successive campaigns of four
months, separated by long intervals during which the tent is
repaired, usually result in so much wear' as to indicate the
necessity of replacing it."
It is an opinion among certain French fournisseurs and fabri-
cants of awnings that linen canvas, when exposed to the
weather, lasts about a third longer than cotton. Per contra, the
opinion of American sail-makers is that linen "rots quicker"
than cotton, and "because of its tendency to absorb water."
Now it is a well-known fact that flax and hemp are exceed-
ingly hygrometric, and imbibe water rapidly whenever it is
present in the atmosphere. Coulier found that common cotton
and linen sheetings imbibed moisture hygrometrically in the
<pb>
proportion of 0-084 and 0-153 to the gramme of each;1 that is to
say, linen showed nearly twice the moisture-absorbing power of
cotton. Coulier also established the fact that the hygrometric
properties of linen tissues, increased in proportion to their coarse-
ness. But this is not all: not only do the hygrometric pro-
perties of the flax fibre cause linen canvas to absorb more
moisture than cotton canvas would do under the same circum-
stances, but the structure of linen canvas, the openness of its
meshes, causes it to hold a still larger proportion of water when
exposed to dew, mist, and rain; while cotton canvas similarly
exposed, to use the expressive language of one of my corre-
spondents, "sheds water like a board."
Moreover, flax and hemp, especially the latter, contain much
more organic matter than cotton in addition to the purely
textile fibres, and even these are always more or less glued
together by a gummy, resinous substance known as pectin. So
that instead of being composed as are the fibres of cotton, of
simple elementary cells, the linen fibre is composed of cells
soldered together by foreign matter—matter which is moreover
soluble in water.2
The hygrometricity of hemp and flax, and the large pro-
portion of organic matter they contain, cause these substances
to be very Uable to ferment and rot when brought together
in large quantities, as on board of ships and in warehouses.
The danger thus sustained by cargoes of hemp is often very
great, and it is a rule among shippers never to take on board
hemp in damp, wet weather; special precautions also are always
adopted to preserve the cargo from dampness and subsequent
heating.
These facts would certainly seem to indicate that flax and
hemp tissues are more affected by climatic conditions than those
of cotton, and that linen fabrics are more likely to become rotten
when long exposed to dampness.
Mildew, or the development of cryptogamia in the tissue of
the canvas, is only a name given to a way in which canvas
1 M. Michel Levy, "Traite' d'Hygieno," tome ii. p. 101.
* Alcan, op. cit. p. 94.
<pb>
becomes rotten; but its chief predisposing cause appears to be
moisture, and where this is associated with a warm temperature
the disease is pretty sure to soon manifest itself. This is one of
the chief specific causes of the destruction of tents in certain
climates, and every one acquainted with the subject knows that,
even in France, one of the difficulties connected with preserving
tents arises from their liability to become covered with les piqures.
Indeed, the physical qualities of linen would seem to especially
expose it to such attacks.
We may fairly conclude, therefore, that if in exceptionably
dry climates, or where great care is taken, linen is more durable
than cotton, the advantage in this respect would be quite on the
side of cotton when exposed to moisture or the climatic or
special conditions which favour the development of cryptogamic
spores.
The frequency with which canvas, whether of flax or cotton,
is destroyed or seriously damaged by mildew, has led to various
attempts to protect it from this special cause of injury. Generally
the object in view has been to preserve the sails of ships; but so
far as I have learned, attempts in that direction have met with
a comparatively limited success. During the War of the Re-
bellion the American Government made a considerable number
of experiments, the object of which was to test the value of
certain preparations that were said to have preservative quali-
ties when applied to tent canvas. But I have been officially in-
formed that these preparations all proved to be of little, if of
any, value. Still, the end to be gained has appeared to be of so
much importance as to recently induce the Government to com-
mence a new series of experiments, and "with the promise of
more favourable results."
A few years since, the house Husson, of Paris, which is
largely engaged in the manufacture of coverings for vans, &c.,
adopted a process which they assure me has been very, if not
entirely, successful in protecting such coverings, whether of
cotton or linen, against mildew. These coverings, if not worn
out, are affirmed to last eight or ten years. The process em-
ployed by the house Husson consists essentially in passing the
canvas through a bath containing a solution of the sulphate of
E E
<pb>
copper. Canvas so treated shrinks, and becomes more dense,
and to the same extent more impermeable. It also takes a light
green colour; but the principal and most important alteration
effected is said to be a very greatly diminished liability to rot
and mildew.
The cotton canvas employed in the construction of the tents
used as an experimental hospital by M. Le Fort, in the grounds
of the Hospital Cochin, had been prepared by the house Husson
in the way mentioned; and it is perhaps not one of the least
interesting facts connected with M. Le Fort's experiment that
after four years' constant exposure the coverings of his tents
were still in excellent condition.
With regard to the other causes of destruction (accidents, &c.),
they act with nearly, if not quite, equal force on cotton and
linen tents.
The single respect therefore—so far as durability is concerned
—in. which linen coverings would seem to have an advantage
over those of cotton is their greater tenacity—their smaller like-
lihood to be torn. But linen loses its strength all the while
much more rapidly than cotton; so that after a limited service
there is really very little difference, even with regard to tenacity,
between the two tissues.
The question of first cost is one of scarcely less consequence.
In the United States, since the great extension given to the cul-
ture of the cotton plant, nearly all cotton fabrics have been
considerably cheaper than corresponding fabrics of flax. Tent
coverings, as well as the sails of ships, are now made in the
United States almost exclusively of cotton. The small quantity
of linen canvas used is of foreign production, and, paying a
duty, costs in the market about 10 per cent. more than cotton
duck of a corresponding grade.
In certain countries, however, the most immediate evidence of
the comparative cheapness of using linen tent coverings has
appeared in their smaller first cost price as compared with the price
of corresponding cotton tissues. In Europe, the price of cotton
per kilogramme has always been greater than that of flax; and
one of the results of the American Rebellion was an enormous
increase in this difference in cost.
<pb>
Undressed Belgian and Picardy flax has cost, in France, for
several years, from 130 to 140 francs per 100 kilogrammes. In
1861, the price in the French market of short staple Georgia
cotton ranged from 198 to 216 francs per 100 kilogrammes; but
in 1863 the price of the same grade ranged from 580 to 640 francs
per 100 kilogrammes. Since the American War, the prices of
cotton have fallen, and the quality specified now ranges in price
from 220 to 250 francs per 100 kilogrammes.
While, however, the first cost of a pound of cotton is now
considerably greater in Europe than that of a pound of flax, the
manufacture of a given weight of cotton is attended with greatly
less waste of raw material, and is accomplished with much less
labour. In short, cotton is converted into cloth much more
economically than flax.
If in 1861 raw flax cost in France 135 francs per 100 kilo-
grammes, and cotton in bale 209 francs per 100 kilogrammes,
canvas of equal weights could have been manufactured as cheaply
from cotton as from flax.
It is in France generally estimated that the manufacture of
flax into tent canvas is attended by a waste in the course of
dressing, carding, &c., of from 40 to 45 per cent. Thus, 100
kilogrammes of raw flax are generally found to be composed as
follows:—
Kilogrammes.
Long fibres . . . 60 to 55
Tow 35 to 40
Shives, Dust, &c.... 5 5
100 100
But the waste of dressing is also increased from 15 to 18 per
cent. during the operations of spinning, weaving, &c., so that
60 kilogrammes of long fibres—representing 100 kilogrammes of
flax before dressing—only furnish an average of 50 kilogrammes
of tissue.
I am not able to give the exact amount of waste attending the
conversion of given samples of American cotton into tent duck.
It is certain, however, that raw cotton contains proportionally
greatly less waste than either flax, hemp, or wool. According
<pb>
to M. Alcan, the better qualities of cotton yield a maximum
waste of from 5 to 7 per cent. in being prepared for the carding
machine, while the waste in carding ranges from 6 to 9 per cent.1
In short, we have a waste of perhaps 10 per cent. attending pro-
cesses which are followed by a waste of 40 or 45 per cent. when
flax is used. The small amount of foreign non-textile mat-
ter in raw cotton not only results in an immediate economy, but
reduces the expense of the processes preparatory to spinning and
weaving. But even these processes are more cheaply conducted.
The cost price of spinning 1000 metres of No. 18 cotton yarn is
in France, according to M. Alcan, 0-14 francs, while the cost of
spinning an equal measure of flax yarn of the same number is
0'17 francs—a difference of 3 per cent.2
So many special circumstances affect the prices of textile
fabrics, that it is almost impossible to establish a just com-
parison between the nominal prices in different countries of even
quite similar grades of tissue; moreover, the commercial or con-
tract price in no case represents the net cost of production.
Nevertheless certain facts relating to the prices of linen and
cotton tent tissues may not be without a certain interest.
The French Government now pays for regulation (flax) tent
canvas 1 franc and 70 centimes per metre.
English regulation (flax) tent canvas costs the Government
9ij<f. per yard.
Italian regulation (cotton) tent duck costs the Government
2 francs per metre.
American 8-oz. (common tent) cotton duck costs in the market
25 cents currency (about 20 cents gold) per yard.
American 14-oz. (hospital tent) cotton duck costs in the market
45 cents currency (about 37 cents gold) per yard.

In other words, the relative prices of equal superficies of
French, English, and American tent tissues of the specified quali-
ties are to each other as 31 = 23 = 45. It should be observed,
however, that the French and English tissues are lighter than
the American, a circumstance which reduces somewhat the ap-
parent difference in the prices. Thus, 6,498 square centimetres
of American 8-oz. duck cost but 20 cents (1-08 francs, or 10c?.).
But, on the other hand, 7,500 square centimetres of Italian 7^-oz.
(cotton) canvas cost 37 cents (2 francs, or 19c?.), the relative
prices of equal superficies of American and Italian canvas of
nearly the same grade thus being to each other as 23 to 37.
The causes of the relatively high price of the Italian duck can-
not be attributed even principally to the relatively high price of
raw cotton in the Italian market. But it is not my purpose to
investigate this subject.
We may conclude from the facts here presented that canvas of
a given quality can, at the present prices of the two raw mate-
rials, be made in the United States more economically of cotton
than of flax; as also that where, as in France at the present time,
the price of raw cotton is not more than 60 or 70 per cent. higher
than that of undressed flax, canvas of a specified weight and
quality can be manufactured from the one substance nearly, if
not quite as cheaply, as from the other.1
An inquiry [concerning the relative merits and demerits of
tissues of cotton, flax, and hemp, when employed as coverings
for tents, will show that they depend for the most part upon the
mechanical structure of the tissues and the physical properties
of the materials of which the tissues are made.
1 It may be remarked that the prices of cotton canvas in Europe are still controlled
by the exaggerated prices commanded by cotton a few years since. Thus, English
7-oz. tent duck now sells in London, nominally, at one shilling a yard (27 in.
wide). But this price represents the former cost of cotton, a limited market, &c.
rather than the actual cost of producing the tissue to-day, when Georgia " ordinary"
and " middlings" are quoted in the Liverpool market at 10-J-cZ. to 10Jei. per pound.
Special duties and a depreciated currency may also, in certain countries, give an
inflation to prices. Probably causes of this kind partly explain the very high cost of
Italian duck, as also of Austrian (linen) tent canvas, which, while lighter than the
French, or even the English regulation canvas, yet costs the Austrian Government,
per metre of 78 centimetres width, 69 kreutaers, a sum equal to T79 francs.
<pb>
It seems to be very difficult to weave the large, hard, and
inelastic threads of flax and hemp in such a way as to com-
pletely close the meshes—at least, without fabricating a tissue
excessively, stiff. In any event, linen tent canvas is never very
closely woven, and is filled with almost innumerable visible aper-
tures. Hence its great permeability to rain, to the rays of the sun,
and to wind. Linen tents promise a shelter, and they oftentimes
furnish none. The slightest rainfall sifts through them to an
extent not only uncomfortable but prejudicial as well to the
health of those under them. Nor is this the only evil which
arises from their permeability to rain. It often becomes very
difficult under linen tent coverings to keep the food, clothing,
and arms of the soldiers from being spoiled or seriously damaged.
Even in dry weather the occupants of linen tents are constantly
liable to be incommoded by humidity—so much so, indeed, as to
make it necessary to have recourse to special precautionary
measures.1
. During the War of the Rebellion, and after the price of cotton
had become excessive, a considerable number of linen tents were
purchased by the American Government. But their issue was
soon discontinued, and for the very sufficient reason that, to use the
words of the Quartermaster-General, " American soldiers will not
use linen tents without grumbling." The Government therefore
concluded, and most wisely, to issue tents which, although then
purchased at nearly three times their usual cost, should fairly
answer the purpose for which they were intended.
Another objection to the use of linen tent coverings is that they
furnish a less complete protection against both excessive heat
and cold. The rays of the sun strike through the imperfectly
closed meshes of the canvas, sometimes with almost unabated
force. That such tents are hotter in the summer than those of
cotton is also partly owing to their colour; and this is one of the
reasons why white cotton tents are almost universally preferred
1 "In dry weather and moonlight nights the dew is abundant even under tents
(French); the clothing, the boots which are to be worn the next day, everything
which may be injured by dampness, should be covered up, or shut up in a valise."—
Etudes sur I'Etablissanent de* Tentes dans les Camps. Paris, 1869, p. 26.
<pb>
in tropical or semi-tropical latitudes. That linen tents are at
times colder than those made of cotton results also from several
special facts. While linen tissues are more pervious to water
and sunlight than those of cotton, they are also more pervious to
air, and from the same cause. American sailors will tell you
that their sails hold the wind better than foreign sails. And their
assertion is true. The cold, dry wind readily penetrates through
linen and hempen tissues, and thus renders tents made of them
very uncomfortable quarters during blustering, wintry weather.
Again, while linen is- a better conductor of caloric per se,
its hygrometric properties often increase its heat-conducting
capacity. The water held in the tissue of a tent covering
contributes to a loss of heat principally by requiring for its
evaporation a considerable quantity of heat which is in this
way constantly being abstracted from the interior of the tent.
And it should be remembered that all bad conductors of heat,
when more or less saturated with water, dry very slowly, while
good heat conductors dry rapidly. Thus, cotton tents when wet
dry slowly, while linen tents when wet dry much more quickly,
and, consequently, abstract the heat from whatever body may be
near them much more rapidly.
But the statement which I have made on a preceding page,
that the open meshes of linen canvas cause it to hold more water
when wet than would a similar surface of cotton canvas, may be
denied. It may be said that linen threads swell when wet, and
that most of the apertures visible in dry linen canvas cease to be
visible when the canvas is wet. It is quite true that after
French regulation canvas has been rained upon for a while nearly
all the meshes are closed up—that is to say, cease to be visibly
open. But the hygrometricity of the material causes the water
to penetrate through the canvas and diffuse itself over the inner
surface. When wet upon one side, linen stuffs soon become wet
upon both sides, while cotton stuffs, when wet on one side, remain
dry on the other. The hose of garden-engines is occasionally made
of cotton or linen canvas. Hose of good linen canvas leaks at
first; the meshes close up as the canvas becomes wet, and it
ceases to leak rapidly; but the surface of the hose continues to
sweat profusely. Hose of good cotton canvas does not leak
<pb>
immediately, and either does not sweat or sweats under the same
pressure, greatly less than that of linen.
Again, it may be said that a given weight of cotton canvas
will absorb or hold in suspension more water than an equal
weight of linen canvas. I readily admit that cotton cloth will
hold in suspension more water than an equal weight of linen cloth;
and this fact needs a word of explanation.
There is a great difference between the hygrometricity of
matter and its power to hold water in suspension. Hygrome-
tricity is a word used to express the property which matter
possesses of absorbing the vapour of water. Substances possess
this property in very different degrees; but this property, whether
possessed in a high or low degree, is no measure of their capacity
to imbibe or take up water when they are immersed in that fluid.
Cotton tissues, if immersed in water for a certain length of time,
will take up and hold in suspension—by what is termed interposition
—more water than similar linen tissues. Thus, while according
to Coulier's table, cotton cloths for linings absorbed in a given time
hygrometrically 0-084 grammes of water for each gramme of cloth,
and each gramme of linen linings in the same time absorbed
hygrometrically 0-153 grammes of water, after immersion the
cotton linings were found to contain 0-903 grammes of water to
each gramme, and the linen but 0-580 grammes of water to
each gramme.
So in an experiment made by myself. On taking a piece of
French regulation canvas containing 40 square centimetres, I
found it weighed, when dry, 2-2 grammes; at the same time, a
piece of American 14-oz. duck, containing an equal number of
square centimetres, weighed, when dry, also exactly 2-2 grammes.1
After having immersed both pieces in a tumbler of water for ten
1 It may be noticed that equal measures of French canvas and American 14-oz.
duck in this instance had equal weights. Theoretically, the duck should have been
slightly the heaviest. Now small equal linear measures of even the same piece of
tissue rarely have equal weights. Moreover, it is practically very difficult to
measure surfaces of tissue with exactness. The condition in the experiment of
most consequence was that equal weights of tissue be used. As a matter of fact. a
reason why cotton tissues can hold more water, in a state of interposition, than linen
tissues, is their relatively greater bulkiness.
<pb>
minutes, on weighing them—after the water had ceased to drop
from them—I found the piece of linen weighed 3-6 grammes, and
the piece of cotton 3-9 grammes; that is to say, the piece of linen
had taken up 1-4 grammes of water, and a piece of cotton canvas
of an equal weight and an equal surface had taken up 1-7 grammes
of water. This fact—the water-holding power of cotton—is not
surprising ; it is a natural and inevitable result of the relative
looseness and elasticity of cotton tissues. Woollen fabrics,
which are still more elastic, as a consequence take up and hold
mechanically a vastly greater relative quantity of water.
The facts now stated would seem to militate against some of
the special advantages claimed for cotton tissues. But it should
be remembered that the property of holding water in suspension
by interposition is quite independent of the penetrability or
impermeability of the substance possessing that property. Good
cotton canvas coverings, when exposed to the rain, are rarely wet
through—are rarely saturated with water. Good linen canvas
coverings are easily wet through and saturated; and it is precisely
because they are so easily saturated that the beating of the rain
or the flapping of the canvas shakes the fine spray from the inner
surface of linen coverings. When used as a tent covering, with
one surface exposed to the rain, French canvas contains more
water per square metre than American duck, as well in a state of
interposition as hygrometrically. As a result, therefore, of its
mechanical and physical qualities and properties, French linen
canvas is damper in fair weather and wetter in rainy weather
than American cotton canvas.
The facility with which hemp and flax absorb moisture results
in another objection to the use of tissues made of these materials
for the construction of tent coverings. In proportion as they
become damp and wet they shrink, and become hard, stiff, and
disagreeable to handle. It is difficult to pitch tents when wet,
and also difficult to pack them ; when pitched it is frequently
impossible to close the doors and windows from the same cause.1
1 An order was issued by the French Government in 1843 that after every rain-
fall the tents should be thrown open until they were dry. "Yes," it has been re-
marked, " when they have the time to dry; but if it is towards evening it had
<pb>
The shrinkage also is often so considerable as to endanger the
stability of the tent, the tent pins being frequently drawn out of
the ground, and the canvas torn at the points where the cords
are inserted. Cotton canvas also shrinks when wet, but it
shrinks much less than linen.
An objection has been made to the use of cotton canvas on
account of its whiteness, which, it has been suggested, might in
camp be provocative of certain affections of the eyes.1 I am in-
clined to believe such an influence to be quite theoretical; more-
over, cotton canvas, when exposed to the air, soon loses its white-
ness, and if such was not the fact, some tint might easily be
given to it by the manufacturer.
In view of the facts here presented, I shall not hesitate to
affirm that cotton tissues are intrinsically greatly to be preferred
to those of hemp and flax for tent coverings; and I believe also
that an extended experimentation would show that, taking
all the causes into consideration which deteriorate tents, tents
made of cotton stuffs are more durable than those made of linen.
Flax tent tissues can be furnished in Europe at the present time
undoubtedly somewhat more cheaply than those of cotton;
still the very important question arises—is the small economy
secured by this fact an equivalent for the inferior quality of such
tissues? I am very much inclined to doubt if it is in any case;
—it certainly is no equivalent when these inferior tissues are
employed in the construction of hospital tents, where imper-
meability to rain and wet is one of the first and most indis-
pensable of conditions.
better not be done, for if the tents have not entirely dried they cannot be closed."
And the same writer in another place observes:—" In damp weather the canvas
shrinks and the tent is closed- with difficulty, all the fissures gape," &c.—Elude sur
VEtablissement des Tentes dans les Camps, op. cit.

MAY resume this account which I have given of the
characteristics and qualities of the tents now in use by
indicating in general, and in brief, the qualities which
a hospital tent should possess.
Its form should be well adapted to its special use; it should
have walls as high as compatible with solidity, and it should be
rectangular, that each tent may, the occasion permitting, serve
as a unit in a series. It should be covered with material fairly
impermeable to rain, while not impermeable to air. It should
have a double roof, as much to shelter it from the sun as from
the rain. Proper ventilation should be secured; first,—by two
doors facing each other; secondly,—by so disposing the walls
that they can at any time be easily raised; thirdly,—by a sufficient
number of openings at the ridge. It should be easy to pitch,
and stand sturdily in its place ; it should be easy to strike, and
so light as to be but a small burden for a horse or a mule.
It should be simple in its construction, and be provided with
no fixture which, if broken or lost, cannot anywhere be extem-
porized. The standards should be as few in number as pos-
sible, and of wood rather than metal. The pickets and pegs
should be made of hard wood, and no more cordage should be
used than is absolutely indispensable for the security of the
tent. The cordage also should be so arranged as to incommode
as little as may be those having occasion to walk near the tent;
the doorways especially should be unobstructed by stay-ropes.
And, finally, the tent should be made of the very best materials,
each of the best quality, and all fitted together in the most skil-
ful and conscientious manner. Indeed, these conditions cannot
be insisted upon too strongly. The whole result—the success
or the failure—in every attempt to hospitalize the sick in tents,
will depend upon the fidelity with which these final conditions
have been observed in their construction.
<pb>
The form of the tent, as well as many of those architectural
dispositions upon which I have spoken at some length, have
merely a secondary importance, since the very best model might
be worse than worthless if constructed of unsuitable materials.
One of the principal objections to the use of tents has arisen
solely from the poor quality of the canvas which has too fre-
quently been used in their construction. Much of the complaint
in the English camps in the Crimea was occasioned by this
fact. "We cover," said the correspondent of the "Times,"
"numberless vans and railway waggons at home with durable
tarpaulin; we cover our soldiers abroad with tents made of
porous canvas such as Pickford would scorn to use." The
immediate consequences of the use of tents made of such materials
were certainly deplorable, but scarcely more so than some of the
conclusions loosely drawn from the experience.
Unfortunately the tendency to reason from particulars to
universals is so strong, that few men can form an idea of any-
thing which belongs to a class, without attributing to it all the
properties which they themselves have observed in certain indi-
vidual members of that class. Those who have only seen leaky
tents, suppose that all tents must leak. Those who have only
known uncomfortable tents, suppose that all tents must be un-
comfortable. Indeed, it is often painful to hear the opinions
upon tent hospitalization of persons who never saw a good
tent, and who, because they may have known certain miserable
sick to have been deluged by autumnal rains under the worth-
less canvas of some single-roofed troop-tent, rush to the
conclusion, that tents in general are responsible for results,
which can only justly be attributed to the most flagrant faults in
their construction.
If the sick are to be treated under tents, particularly if it is
proposed to establish a comparison between the results there ob-
tained and those obtained where other kinds of shelter are re-
sorted to, it is quite indispensable that the tents employed
be fairly suitable for the service in which they are to be used, or
at least that the tents selected for the experiment be not
the very worst specimens of tent architecture that ignorance
and parsimony may have constructed.
<pb>
In selecting a spot upon which to pitch the tent—presuming
that the general location of the camp or hospital shall have been
chosen so far as possible in accordance with sanitary laws—a
hard, gravelly soil is to be preferred. Such soils are naturally
dry, and are the most amenable to drainage. Gardens and
smooth lawns should be shunned above all places. This is a
point which can scarcely be sufficiently insisted upon, since they
are of all places the most attractive in bright, dry weather; but
they are generally difficult to drain, and at the very first
heavy rainfall the artificial soil with which they are covered will
be seen oozing through the smooth green turf, to finally convert,
should the season be wet, the whole surface around into a
quagmire, that will probably baffle every effort to suppress it.
This is a serious inconvenience; but perhaps the gravest objection
is that such soils contain more or less decomposing matter, and
may possess all the necessary conditions preliminary to becoming
the chief factors in the propagation of camp infections.
Again, a hard gravelly soil gives to the tent a more solid foot-
ing, and the tent pegs once driven into the ground will be found
to hold firmly both in wet and dry weather. It is well to secure
a place which has a slight slope, as it also occasionally may be to
profit by the protection afforded against some prevailing wind
by the brow of a hill or a grove of trees; but the attainment of
such conditions is secondary to that of securing a spot where the
character of the soil itself is least objectionable.
It has often been recommended that tents be placed under
trees.1 The object, of course, is to obtain a shade. In dry tropical
climates tents may be so placed; but such locations are gene-
rally in temperate latitudes highly objectionable by reason of the
1 It has been said to have been a rule among the Romans to encamp their troops
under trees in all hot countries. The rule referred to is probably that of Vegetius,
who says :—" Soldiers should not be encamped upon arid mountains or fields desti-
tute of the shade of trees." "Ne aridis et sine opacitate arborum campis, aut collibus
. . . milites commorentur." (Lib. iii. c. 2.) While it would be very difficult to
construe this passage into an advice to encamp men under trees, in practice such
encampments were certainly not common in Roman armies. To have a few trees
in the camp, or to have many upon its borders or in its immediate neighbourhood
is often to be desired.
<pb>
constant dripping from the trees during wet weather, and the
relative humidity which always exists in their immediate neigh-
bourhood. A location under single trees is also objectionable
on account of the eddies of wind which they create—to say nothing
of the special dangers they may invite in countries where thunder-
storms are common. Moreover, direct sunlight not only exerts
a hygienic influence of great value, but it is a most powerful
disinfectant, and hospital tents should be fairly exposed to its
action. By using tents with flys, and capable of being freely
opened on all sides, the solar heat will only very rarely in tem-
perate climates be an occasion of discomfort.
In pitching a tent. the pickets should be pointed well towards
its walls, and driven deeply into the ground. The cords and
stay-ropes should be so adjusted that they may be easily
tightened or slackened to correspond with the variations in the
tension of the canvas occasioned by the presence or absence of
atmospheric moisture; and I may add, that the coverings of tents
when first pitched should be left rather too slack than too tense.
The ground should be ditched to correspond with the lines of
the watershed,1 as also properly prepared within the tent. Some
sort of flooring should be employed if the tent is to remain long
in the same place. In any event, the earth within it should be
well beaten down, or what is much better, if one has the time
and means, the surface soil should be removed and be replaced
by gravel or sand. In placing the beds or other articles of furni-
ture in a tent, care should be taken that they do not press upon
the walls or even rest against them, and no object should be sus-
pended from any part of the canvas.
1 It has been said that "half an hour's work on a wet day, when the natural
run of the water can be seen, will do more to keep the camp healthy than a day's
labour in dry weather." (" Eegulations and Instructions for Encampments," War
Office, 2nd June, 1872.) However true this statement may be, it should never
induce one to omit, where rain may be expected, to establish trenches around the
tents immediately after they are pitched; to wait until "the natural run of the water
can be seen," would be in many cases to wait until, by being " drowned out," the
occupants of the tent had been taught how important trenches are.

i]HE various objections which have at times been urged
against tents have induced certain persons to recom-
mend the abandoning of attempts to hospitalize the sick
and wounded under canvas, except in the absence of other
means of shelter; while other persons, recognizing that a canvas
shelter may possess certain advantages, have endeavoured to
remedy the faults presumed to be special to tents by modifying
their construction, by building them more solidly, and giving to
them some of the characteristics of ordinary habitations. Such
modified tents have usually consisted of frame-works, covered with
canvas only in part, the remaining portions of the construction
—the roof or the sides, as the case might be—being formed of
boards or some other substantial covering. These constructions
—half tent and half hut, like some of the old Roman tabernacula
—have received the name of tent-barracks. Indeed, the re-
inventors of tent-barracks have proposed something more posi-
tive than a mere correction of the faults of tents; they announce
that these constructions, when used as hospitals, unite all the
special advantages of tents with all the special advantages of
barracks.
The following are said to be some of their principal advan-
tages. They can be opened to the air much more freely than
barracks; they can also be erected considerably more cheaply.
It is not necessary to transport them from place to place; they
can be erected when and where they are needed; they can be
easily built so as to afford more room than can be obtained in
tents; the interior space can be arranged more conveniently, and
can be more completely furnished. Tent-barracks stand more
steadily than tents, and one is less troubled within them by the
Bwaying, rustling, and flapping of canvas; they moreover suggest
to their occupants more of security than tents do, and they really
afford greater security in several respects. They are not only
<pb>
not as easily blown down, but they are not as easily broken
down. They are provided with doors and with windows, &c. &c.
Some of these relative advantages which I have specified I believe
to be rather nominal than real. The tent-barrack certainly has
one advantage over the tent—it has windows. If this be a cir-
cumstance of no great hygienic consequence, it is nevertheless of
considerable importance. People, whether sick or well, certainly
do like to look out of doors; a window, next to a fire-place, is
generally the most cheerful spot in a room. We can get along
without windows just as we can without fire-places, but most
people would prefer to have both in an apartment where they
were to remain a long time.
But if something can be said in favour of tent-barracks, much
also can be said against them. They are non-portable construc-
tions, and it requires some time to erect them and fit them up as
hospitals. They must, consequently, be prepared in anticipation
of occasions, of opportunities of special usefulness which may
never occur; their use is thus limited to sedentary establish-
ments.
A tent-barrack exposes to infection more material than a tent
does, while it is much less easy to cleanse and thoroughly dis-
infect it. Not being portable it cannot be easily removed to a new
locality should the outbreak of an epidemic render such a
movement desirable. Should it be removed, it would be almost
certain to carry the germs of the infection with it. It is quite as
difficult to properly heat a tent-barrack as it is a tent, and from
the same cause—the rapid loss of heat. Where the same means
of heating are employed, the heat will generally be found to be
more equally distributed at any given time within a tent than
within a tent-barrack. The air escapes from a closed tent, as it
also enters it, equally over a large surface. The cold air enters
a tent-barrack very unequally—in short, its natural ventilation
when closed is inferior to that of a tent. Always more subject
to draughts and currents of air than tents, tent-barracks are
quite as likely to become disagreeably warm in the hot sunshine,
while they are, through the joints of careless carpentry and
loosely fitting curtains, even more permeable to wet than cotton
tents. Nor do they realize a single important advantage pos-
<pb>
sessed by barracks over tents. Barracks protect both persons and
property, in several respects, much better than tents. But tent-
barracks, as well as tents, may be torn, broken down, perhaps
overturned. Canvas is by no means a sure protection even
against projectiles thrown by hand. A person without difficulty
may enter or escape from a tent or tent-barrack clandestinely
through the door, or by raising a wall, or pushing aside a curtain;
valuable articles cannot therefore be kept with safety in such
constructions. But barracks cannot be easily entered except
by the doors, and these can be bolted or locked. Barracks can
be made comfortable by ordinary means of heating—by common
stoves and fire-places. Barracks can be divided into rooms
which afford privacy to their occupants. Now a tent-barrack
commonly lacks quite as much as a tent the special qualities
to which I refer, qualities which have caused barracks to be very
generally preferred to tents in the organization of military hos-
pitals, and always, I believe, for the different offices connected
with such establishments.1
Nevertheless, there are undoubtedly many competent judges
who believe that tent-barracks are not only better than tents for
office purposes, but that for the hospitalization of the sick they
possess nearly all the special advantages of tents, while free from
some of their peculiar disadvantages. In short, the tent-barrack
has been considered as an establishment which combined in itself
the merits of both the barrack and the tent, to the exclusion of
the defects peculiar to each. To what extent this opinion is well
founded I shall leave you yourself to judge, after I have de-
scribed the three or four forms of tent-barrack now best known.
1 Barracks certainly possess over tents many great advantages of convenience.
But considerations of special convenience should not be allowed to unduly influence
the dispositions and character of the constructions which are to form a hospital.
It is to be presumed that hospitals are built rather for the welfare of the sick than
the convenience of the well. Houses and barracks furnish to surgeons, nurses, and
attendants more comfortable quarters than it is usual to find in tents, and I am
inclined to believe that a knowledge of this fact has greatly delayed and interfered
with the general adoption in armies of what is called the open-air treatment of the
sick. But the general use of tents for the sick and wounded would rarely neces-
sarily preclude the employment of those kinds of shelter best suited for other and
special purposes.
<pb>
One of the earliest models (represented by Fig. 36) was used by
the Prussians during the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. It con-
sisted of a framework supporting a wooden roof with a double
pitch. The roof projected laterally, and was open at the ridge
the whole length, the opening being shielded by a false roof. The
gable ends were boarded down as far as the tie-beams; a floor
elevated above the ground, about a foot, was put in the con-
struction.
This barrack was characterized by its walls, both on the front
and on the sides; these were formed of canvas curtains perma-
nently attached to the plates and tie-beams. By means of the

curtains the interior of the barrack could be completely enclosed,
or it could be thrown open to the air more or less completely by
pushing the curtains aside or by polling them up and securing
them at the top by buttons.
Another form, in some respects simpler, also used during the
same war, is described by Fischer.1 It differed from the one repre-
sented in Fig. 36 in being unprovided with a floor and in
having lateral wooden walls, the upper halves of which were mov-

37 were taken from this work.)
<pb>
able. In this barrack the ends alone were furnished with cur-
tains, as shown in Fig. 37.
During the Austro-Prussian War the experiment was made at
Trautenau by Volkmann of employing, for the treatment of the
wounded, a sort of shed-barrack—something like, in its general
appearance, the sheds occasionally used on farms. The experi-
ment was pronounced highly successful. At the suggestion of
Baron Mundy, of Vienna, and in accordance with plans furnished
by him, the "Societe de Secours aux Blesses" organized in
the Park of St. Cloud, in June, 1871, a shed tent-barrack hos-
pital containing two hundred beds; each ward-barrack contained

twenty-five beds. By referring to Fig. 38, which represents one
of these barracks, it will be seen to differ in several respects
from the two forms I have just described. It was practically
a long shed, the front of which was or might be closed by canvas
curtains; it was 98£ ft. long, 16 ft. 4 in. wide, 19 ft. 7 in. high
in front, and 13 ft. high behind. The barracks were frame-
works, covered with boards, battened both on the sides and on
the roof; the roofs were covered also with impermeable tarred
paper. They were painted black on the outside with a heavy
coating of coal tar; on the inside the walls were whitened. Each
barrack was floored with matched boards, and in each the rear
wall was pierced with eight movable windows; the curtains—of
which there were ten—were attached above by rings to iron
<pb>
rods; at the sides and the bottoms they were secured when closed
by buckles and hooks; when opened they might be pushed aside,
or they might be braced out by means of poles, as shown in
the sketch. As the curtains depended from the ridge, the interior
of the barracks could thus be completely exposed to the open air
in fine weather, and without that liability to draughts existing in
constructions open on all sides. One or two of the ward-barracks
were divided into apartments by lateral side curtains. The

barracks were all supplied with water, as they were also with the
furniture common in permanent hospitals.
They were solidly built, and were unquestionably the most
elaborate examples of tent-barrack architecture which have yet
been constructed. It may be observed that in these construc-
tions the barrack predominated over the tent; it was a circum-
stance which added considerably to the first cost of installation,
and may also have been the occasion of a less active aeration,
when the curtains were all closed, than at times may have been
desirable.
<pb>
As no heating apparatus was used in these barracks, there
was no means of forcing the air to circulate within them, and
its purity was only maintained, as it might be in almost any apart-
ment, by keeping a large number of doors and windows open.
If the roofs of the barracks had been of canvas permeable to
air, an interchange between the interior and exterior atmospheres
might have been constantly going on through the tissue, and one
of the advantages of using tents thus secured; but as the cur-
tains were disposed, I am inclined to think that generally when
closed very little air passed through them. The air which then
entered and escaped from the barracks probably accomplished
these acts principally by creeping under the curtains or through
the folds of their loosely fitting sides. As the curtains were only
raised during the day, and when the weather was fine, the portion
of the time during which the barracks were open was really very
small. It was necessary to close the curtains also whenever the
wind blew strongly against the front of a barrack, and in this
event, the air pushing past their imperfectly fitting borders
circulated in gusts in the interior.
As these shed-barracks, while roofed and floored as ordinary
barracks, were thus greatly exposed on one side, it was impos-
sible to place within them but a single row of beds. This fact
alone will always prove a most serious economical objection to
their construction. They were condemned while in use by some
of the most competent French sanitarians, as a "contre-sens
hygienique et economique." 'We have not learned that the
surgical results obtained were remarkable in any respect; and
as the experiment is never likely to be repeated, this verdict may
be accepted as final.1 Where, during the summer season, it
may be impossible to construct a suitable cover from a want of
the proper material, or of sufficient time, a roof or awning may

<pb>
be adjusted to some wall already built, and a shelter thus ex-
temporized, which is better than none, for the sick, and which,
as an annex to a general hospital, might prove useful in the
treatment of convalescents or of special cases. These considera-
tions can alone warrant the construction of shed-barracks.
In 1868 M. Le Fort erected a tent-barrack as an annex to the
Hospital Cochin, that possessed more characteristics peculiar
to the tent than to the barrack. In fact, it offered (to those who
might be treated within it) all the sanitary conditions special to
a tent with double walls. This construction, which is still in
use, and appears in fairly good condition in the fourth year of its

annex to the Hospital Cochin in 1868.1
service, I shall now describe. I would, however, first call your at-
tention to Fig. 39, which will give a general idea of the barrack;
the front wall has been entirely removed, and one lateral
wall lifted up in such a way as to exhibit the interior.
The frame is supported by six posts on each side, and distant
from each other 4 metres, thus giving to it a length of 20 metres;
its breadth is seven metres. The posts are of light wood, square
in form, 10 centimetres thick, and 2 metres 25 centimetres high
above the ground. To each one is attached a principal rafter, a

kind as to furnish him with the electroplates for Figs. 33, 34, 35, and 39.
<pb>
solid plank 4 metres 80 centimetres long ; this crosses at the sum-
mit of the roof, in the form of an X, the rafter from the post
opposite. The upper branches of the X, which are very short, give
a support to the false roof or lantern. Each rafter is united to its
neighbour by a plank 4 metres long, 15 centimetres wide, and 34
millimetres thick; these planks, placed lengthways and edgeways,
form the ridge. A similar plank passes from post to post in such
a way as to form the eaves of the tent, the canvas bending over
it being continued to the ground as a lateral wall. Four or
five light rafters are placed between the principal rafters, to com-
plete and sustain the roof. The principal rafters are kept from
spreading apart by a tie-beam and a king-post. By this arrange-
ment a light but pretty solid framework is obtained. The canvas
is now put on in the following manner :—First, the outer cover-
ing—cotton canvas prepared by being immersed in a solution of
sulphate of copper—is adjusted. This consists of two large
sections, one for each side of the barrack. Each section is drawn
up to the summit of the framework, and each is fastened to the
other by means of straps, which, passing over the ridge-board,
are secured to buckles on the inside of the corresponding section.
The sections of canvas are therefore not directly joined together,
but are separated by an interval of about 6 in. The false
roof is now covered by a hood or band of canvas, which falls
down upon the roof on each side, but is gathered up in such a
way as to permit the free exit of the air which may arise through
the opening between the two sections forming the roof. The
canvas on each side is now drawn down to the angle of the roof,
where it is attached by straps to the horizontal bar or plate
which passes from post to post. The bottom of the canvas is
furnished with loops, by means of which it is attached to hooks
screwed into a piece of timber buried in the ground along the
whole length of the barrack. The inner tent is now arranged:
it is made of white cotton cloth, and consists of two parts, a
ceiling and side walls. The ceiling extends horizontally the
whole length of the barrack, just under the tie-beams, and is
held in its place by cords and wires, which, fastened to the frame-
work above, pass through a series of rings sewed upon the upper
face of the cloth. The ceiling is formed of two lateral sections,
<pb>
between which is an interval of 3 in. or 4 in., corresponding with
the interval or opening immediately above, between the two
sections of the outer covering. The walls of the inner tent now
slope down, following on the inside the course of the rafters, to
the horizontal bars or plates, to which they are attached. To
these bars curtain rods are fastened, from which the perpen-
dicular portions of the walls hang in sections or curtains.
When the weather is fine, the inclined walls of the outer tent
may be raised, as shown in the sketch. They thus form a sort
of covered gallery, where the patient may walk or sit, at the
same time protecting from the sun the interior of the tent.
The perpendicular curtains of the inner tent can be more or
less completely opened, according to the weather, so as even to
place the patients, whenever thought proper, quite in the open
air. This construction is not floored, but the ground was care-
fully prepared, and the surface dressed with coarse gravel;
gutters lined with bitumen conduct the water, shed by the outer
roof, to the street near by. The shelter thus obtained is con-
sidered by M. Le Fort sufficient for eighteen or even twenty-four
beds. Although two stoves are placed in it, the construction
was not designed to be used during the colder months, and it
has been regularly abandoned each year when the weather has
become frosty.
The earliest use of permanent barrack-tents with double walla
appears to have been made at Berlin. In 1864 Dr. Fischer
described one which had been attached to the Charity Hospital of
that city. A plank floor was laid, supported by a series of posts
several feet from the ground. Its length was 114 ft. and its
(interior) breadth 23 ft. A framework was erected upon this
floor, with two rows of wall posts on each side; a tarpaulin
weighing nine or ten hundredweight was placed upon the roof
as a covering. The outer edge, provided with gutters, was
secured to a plate, resting upon the outer fine of posts support-
ing the roof. Canvas curtains were let down from the plates
supported by the first row of wall posts quite to the floor, so as
to form the inner (true) walls of the pavilion; around these was
a gallery covered by the projecting roof. At the outer edge of
the floor of this gallery—a lateral extension of the floor of the
<pb>
pavilion—curtains were placed which could be pulled up by means
of pulleys, so as to quite shut in the gallery. This construction
was therefore a wooden framework roofed by an impermeable
water-tight and air-tight covering, and enclosed on the sides by
two lines of curtains distant from each other the width of the
gallery. The pavilion was divided into two wards by partitions,
between which were a bath-room and water-closet. Each ward
contained twenty-one beds.
It will be seen from these descriptions which I have given of
tent-barracks that there are two kinds or types. In one of these
the construction is essentially a barrack, in the other it is essen-
tially a tent. Nevertheless, in the barrack type many of the
special advantages of the barrack are lost; as I have already
remarked, it affords no security as regards the safe keeping of
either property or persons, neither can constructions of this class
be easily and economically warmed; they have consequently
only been proposed and used for summer hospitals. Their only
advantage over common barracks—aside from their somewhat
smaller cost—seems to be the possibility of throwing them widely
open at the sides. Whether, in order to obtain this object, it is
wise to give to barracks a special form which unfits them for
service during a considerable portion of the year, I am much
inclined to doubt. It seems to me preferable to construct
barracks in such a way that they may fulfil every purpose for
which such buildings are erected, that they may be used at all
seasons of the year, but so arranged that during the warmer
months they may be freely opened to the air by means of
movable walls, or some other device. As for the tent-barrack
which preserves the essential features of the tent—which, in fact,
scarcely differs from a marquee, except in being more solidly
supported within—I can only say that it seems to me to be the
preferable form. It would certainly be very difficult to realize
more completely than M. Le Fort has done, in the large tent
annexed to the Hospital Cochin, the best conditions to be obtained
under a shelter of canvas, not simply during the summer, but as
well during the winter; and I may here again remark that such
a tent is much more easily warmed than any one of the more
barrack-like constructions I have described. The difference in
<pb>
cost between this tent-barrack and those of the first class, if
neatly built, is also usually in its favour.
It seems to me expedient, whenever the occasion may require
the establishment of a military hospital that in all probability
will be used for a year or more, or even for several months, to
employ two kinds of construction—well-built barracks, and
large, strongly-secured tents. The barracks will furnish quarters
for the attendants, can be used as offices, and will afford suitable
store room. They also, if well constructed, if so arranged
that they may be opened freely, will offer to the sick sanitary
conditions scarcely inferior to those obtained, in the finest
portions of the year, in the barracks which most closely re-
semble tents. The large tents will completely secure for the
sick whatever advantages may be derived by treating men
under canvas, advantages which I believe I have elsewhere
satisfactorily shown to be both real and important.
In constructing a tent for use in the field as a campaigning
tent, its size must necessarily be limited. The tent and its fixtures
must be easily transportable, while it should not offer to the wind so
large a surface as to be blown down, when supported and fastened
by the fixtures and pegs which belong to it and are presumed always
to go with it. In constructing a tent for a special service, a
service which gives to the installation more or less of perma-
nency, the transportability of the tent is a quality of less conse-
quence, as is also its solidity, if fastened in the usual manner.
There are a variety of ways by which a tent not excessively
large can be fixed strongly in its place the moment it is decided
to give permanence to the installation. Still, in the con-
struction of a large tent not intended to be frequently trans-
ported and re-pitched, lightness may be a desirable condition.
It should only be so large as to secure within it a conve-
nient interior, and the necessary sturdiness should be obtained
for it by the employment of such fixtures only as are absolutely
indispensable. It should also be made of as few pieces as
possible; the type to be preferred is the simplest one.
The tent proposed by M. Le Fort, although one which would
answer very well in the construction of a military hospital upon
the plan I have suggested, since in the fulfilment of sanitary
<pb>
conditions it leaves scarcely anything to be desired, nevertheless
seems to me to possess certain defects which can, perhaps, be
partially remedied. It is a double tent, one tent being placed
within another larger one. This mechanical fault I have else-
where noticed. The framework is altogether heavier than is
necessary, and there is too much gearing about the tent; more-
over, it cannot be closed up tightly. The employment of numer-
ous curtains attached to sliding rings, and of sidings fastened
by buckles and thongs is objectionable; unclosed apertures
exist everywhere, which let in the air in currents. If it be said
that these apertures serve to ventilate the tent, I can only reply
that this mode of ventilation is often undesirable. In cold, windy
weather, the fewer irregular holes and apertures in the walls of a
tent the better, providing the ventilation is properly maintained,
as it should be, by openings in the roof, and a circulation of air
through the canvas forced, if necessary, by means of a well-contrived
heating apparatus. I should prefer also for a permanent installa-
tion a different floor. If an earth floor is to be used, coarse gravel
is perhaps the best material which can be employed; but however
easy it may be to remove and renew the gravel in places where
it may have been soiled, such a floor must, sooner or later,
become unclean, as well from the detritus of one kind and another
which daily falls upon it, as by reason of its capacity to absorb gases.
Where tents may at any time be repitched, an earth floor may
be sufficient; but if the installation is to be permanent, some
other kind of floor should be used both as a matter of convenience
and of health.
If large tents can be employed with advantage in the organi-
zation of sedentary hospitals, I know of no better form than that
of the American hospital tent, a pavilion covered by a sur-tente,
or " fly." The pavilion may be made large enough to be suffi-
ciently convenient within, and may be strengthened by a frame-
work strong enough to give it the necessary sturdiness. It can,
moreover, be modified in such a way as to permit its being more
easily opened to the air and light than are the American field
tents.
In plate X. (Appendix) may be seen a sketch of a tent designed
by Dr. Thomas W. Evans, and in the construction of which,
<pb>
while endeavouring to secure those qualities particularly desir-
able in an installation that is to have a certain permanence, he
has sought to remedy, so far as it might be done, the mechanical
faults I have noticed in speaking of M. Le Fort's tent, and
several of which are more or less likely to be reproduced in any
attempt to construct a large, strong, sturdy tent, intended to be
used as a sedentary hospital. The pavilion proposed by Dr.
Evans is constructed in the following manner:—Six posts,
square, 4 in. thick, 8 ft. 7 in. long, are sunk into the ground
2 ft. on lines which are to correspond with the side walls of
the tent. The second post is placed 14 ft. from the first; the
third, 14 ft. from the second; the fourth, 4 ft. from the third,
for a reason which will appear; while the fourth, fifth, and
sixth, are 14 ft. apart. The sides of the tent are therefore
60 ft. long.
The upright posts are united on each side by square bars,
rounded on the upper and outer angles, 4 in. thick; these are
placed horizontally from the top of one post to that adjoin-
ing. The extremities of these bars are secured to the posts by
means of sockets.
The two lines of posts are now united at each extremity
by a cross-bar, which is square, 4 in. in diameter, and 20 ft.
in length. The two bars complete the enclosure of a quad-
rangle 60 ft. long by 20 ft. broad. Each one of the end bars is
propped by two upright posts, similar to those on the sides, placed
4 ft. apart. These posts enclose the doorways. A vertical
pole 9 ft. 5 in. long is now erected over the centre of each
doorway, its foot resting in a metallic socket. This standard is
5 in. in diameter at its base, and 3 in. at the top, which is armed
with an iron spindle; it is flattened on its outer face. Two
masts, 6 in. in diameter at the base, and 3 in. at the top, and
11\ ft. long, are sunk in the ground ft. on a line correspond-
ing with the long axis of the quadrangle, 20 ft. apart. These
masts are connected at the top one with the other, as also with
the vertical standards over the doorways, by ridge-poles, three
in number, and each 20 ft. in length; the ridge-poles are
rounded on their upper faces. The two end ridge-poles are
fastened to the upright standards by being passed over the terminal
<pb>
spindles with which the standards are armed. The middle ridge-
pole is attached to its fellows by means of sockets. The skeleton
or framework of the tent is now complete. I have not remarked,
however, an arrangement of considerable importance. Each one
of the sixteen upright wall-posts, of the end standards, and of the
ridge-poles, is furnished with a row of fixed metallic rings, whose
diameter is about £ of an inch. These rings are screwed into
the outer faces of the posts, 6 in. or 8 in. distant one from
the other, and all facing in the same direction upwards and down-
wards; on the ridge-poles they face each other horizontally.
(See Figs. 40 and 43.) Such a framework having been erected,
it remains to be provided with its covering. This consists of
two sections, which are to be united, when erected, at the ends
and at the ridge. Each section forms one long roof, two
triangular gable ends, two end curtains, and five side curtains.
The curtains are all sewed on to the edges of the roof, and
also to the edges of the gable ends. The sides and bottoms of
the curtains are provided with button-holes, so also are the
vertical edges of the gable ends, and the superior edge of the
roof; a narrow lapel projects beyond the line—the angle of the
roof—where the roof and curtains meet; into this lapel are
inserted the tent-ropes, 2 ft. 3 in. one from the other. In erect-
ing the tent, the sections are unrolled on the ground within
the enclosure, the wall curtains being drawn out towards the
side-posts^while the long straight edges of each—the edges con-
taining the button-holes—are laid parallel to each other in the
middle of the enclosure, along the line of its length.
The lopg edge of one of the sections is now lifted up, and,
beginning at one of the extreme ends, the first button-hole is
slipped over the spindle at the extremity of the standard over
the doorway; the button-holes are fastened one after the
other over the rings on the upper surface of the ridge-pole, until
the edge of the section is adjusted along its whole length.
The body of the section is then lifted up and over the hori-
zontal bars—the plates—of the framework, the curtains falling on
the outside. The button-holes in the vertical edge of the gable
end are adjusted to the rings in the standard over the doorway.
The roof is drawn out by the cords attached to the lapel, and
<pb>
pegged to the ground in the ordinary way, or attached to parallel
bars, as shown in Plate X.
The curtains are now buttoned on to the rings in the upright
posts, one curtain edge over the other on the sides, the button-
holes on the lower edge being passed over rings which are placed
in the outer string pieces on which the floor rests (see Fig. 40).
I may here say that, presuming it may not always be convenient
to use a floor, the lower edges of the curtains are furnished
with a series of loops, by means of which the walls can be pegged
to the ground in the ordinary way. The canvas is held fast,
and is prevented from slipping off the rings by passing a cord
through the series, or by means of small keys, as shown in the
illustrations.
I have elsewhere objected to the use of straps, buckles, &c.,
for curtain fastenings, because of the openings which almost
always exist, where such fastenings are employed; it is partly
to reduce the number of such openings that the curtains have
been attached permanently to the roof; it is for the same reason
that the edges of two adjoining curtains have been buttoned,
one curtain over the other, the edges of the curtains over-
lapping slightly for this purpose.
In the curtain which rests upon
.. , m y r x the face of the post, the button-
holes are four or five inches from
\\ %. the edge; the free border forms
*T %j a roll beneath the outer curtain,
^/ J| J in which the button-holes are
close to the edge. The two cur-
tains being pressed down solidly
by the keys or the cord passed
through the rings, this roll breaks
or fills up the joints which would otherwise exist.
The arrangement will be readily understood by a reference to
Fig. 41, where one curtain e is shown buttoned over the ring b in
the post a. The edge of the second curtain d is also buttoned
 
 
Fig. 40.
<pb>
upon b, and will be observed to have been rendered slightly con-
vex by the free edge of the curtain e. Fig. 42 shows a section
of the curtain e buttoned over the rings b b b, with its free edge
c rolled up. The curtain d may be brought forward and but-
toned over b b b, as shown in Fig. 41.
It is now necessary to arrange the fly. This is in three sections,
each 20 ft. broad and about 30 ft. long. It is in sections—first,
—that it maybe the more easily adjusted; secondly,—that the air
between it and the roof of the tent may have a free outlet; this is
desirable not only because a better ventilation within the tent is
thus maintained, but because the strain to which the fly, were it in
one piece, would be subjected whenever the wind is high, is greatly
lessened; thirdly,—that, the season permitting, one or more sec-
tions may be advanced so as to form an awning in front of the tent.
The three sections of the fly are placed upon the portion of the roof,
which we are presumed to have erected, each folded outside in; that
is to say, each section being in its place, one half resting upon the
portion of the tent it is to cover, the other half being thrown
back over it. The fly having been thus placed for the moment,
the section of the tent still supposed to be on the ground is lifted
up, and beginning at the extreme end, the first button-hole is
slipped over the spindle at the extremity of the standard over
the doorway, and the button-holes one after the other are fast-
ened to the rings in the ridge-pole as already described. Before,
however, the second section has been adjusted far, a small per-
forated block or ball, two or three inches in diameter, is pushed
down upon the spindle just mentioned, and the fly is pulled up,
and the hole which will be found near its outer edge and corner
 
Fig. 42.
<pb>
is passed over the top of the spindle; as the second section of the
tent is attached to the ridge-pole, the fly is drawn up and
over on to the same side. Balls are placed on the spindles
of the three remaining standards, after the two sections of
the tent have been united upon them,
and the flys are adjusted as has al-
ready been described. The section
of the tent is now brought forward
over the framework, to which it is
fastened, as in the first instance, and
stayed out by cords similarly at-
tached. The fly is then pulled down
on either side and fastened by cords
to pickets driven into the ground, or
to a bar, as shown in Plate X. The
fly is adjusted as in the common Ame-
rican hospital tents, except in not
resting directly upon the ridge-pole;
the balls placed on the spindles, se-
parating the fly from the tent, permit
the air to circulate more freely be-
tween it and the tent. (The ball is
represented in Fig. 43 by the letter e; its effect to separate the
fly from the roof of the tent b will at once be seen.) The tent as
now pitched has four large unclosed openings; 'those at the ends
are intended to be closed by light swinging doors, those at the
sides with windows—not however necessarily; as will be seen by
looking at Plate X. a curtain can be drawn down to fill the space
intended for the window, should it for any reason be difficult to
obtain one. Ridge ventilation is provided for by louvres which
can be opened or shut at pleasure.
The ventilation, however, will be chiefly secured during cold
weather by the heating apparatus. During the warmer portion
of the year the side and end curtains can be rolled up as shown
in Plate X.; they are sustained by straps, which are employed
when the tent is closed to attach the roof to the bars or plates
which connect the upright posts.
The floor, if one is employed—and one always should be, if
 
Fig. 43.
<pb>
possible, in a permanent installation—it will be best to prepare
before the tent is erected.
The ground should be levelled—in fact, it would be well to re-
move six or eight inches of the top soil, and replace this with
coarse gravel.
String pieces are then to be laid down lengthwise on the sides
of the tent, to furnish an attachment to the lower borders of the
curtains, the other string pieces should traverse the tent; they
should only be large enough to support the floor, and should be
forced into the gravel until their upper faces are level with its
surface. When the flooring is laid it will therefore rest directly
upon the gravel.
The floor will be made of rough unmatched boards; and it should
always be covered by an impermeable oilcloth over its whole
surface. Such a floor is perhaps as perfect as it is possible to
have in a temporary hospital. It is solid, not dusty, contains no
dead air beneath it, no foul matter can accumulate under it, it is
non-absorbent of gases, and can always be easily and very
perfectly cleansed.
But some one may ask:—Why not allow the outdoor air to
circulate freely under the floor, as it did beneath the American
barrack hosjjitals? This arrangement, permitting the outdoor
air to sweep them on every side, was supposed to contribute
much to their healthfulness. But if the floor is impermeable and
contains nothing offensive under it, there is no reason why it can
be desirable to secure a constant change of the air beneath it.
Another and more weighty reason is this: if the outdoor air were
permitted to circulate freely beneath the floor of the tent, our
ground heat during the winter would be lost. When the weather
becomes cold, the tent should be heated by the introduction of
hot air in the way described at length in Part III. of this Report.
How important a factor this ground heat is, in the maintenance
of a steady temperature within a tent, will there be shown.
The doors, the upper portions of which may be furnished with
windows, may be protected during the winter months by portals
or vestibules. Paved gutters should be placed on each side of
the tent. It will be found advantageous to fix the tent in the
manner indicated in the Plate, by attaching the tent-cords to
G u
<pb>
parallel bars; not only is the inconvenience of cordage avoided,
but the stability of the tent is thus assured. The tent is in-
tended to accommodate sixteen patients. There is room for
eighteen beds, but it will generally be found convenient to sup-
press two of these to gain room for furniture, &c.
A tent constructed like the one described would be greatly
superior to the American hospital tent, for the organization of
sedentary hospitals. It is much more spacious, and is relatively
less costly.
To form a pavilion 56 ft. in length, four United States
hospital tents are required. The canvas of the six ends which
meet is superfluous—it is more than this, it is decidedly objec-
tionable. It serves to form dead corners, and offers a large
amount of material to be impregnated and infected by miasmatic
exhalations.
I believe Dr. Evans' tent to be superior in construction to
M. Le Fort's tent, on account of its greater simplicity. There
are seventy-one pieces in the framework of M. Le Fort's pavilion;
there are but thirty-three in the model I have just described and
would commend.
While not designed to follow an army in all its movements, it
is not too heavy, including the framework, to be occasionally
carried in the train. In well-timbered countries a part, or even
the whole, of the framework may be left behind; it would re-
quire but a small amount of labour to prepare a framework suffi-
cient to sustain the canvas, which is the essential part of the
construction.
This model is also peculiarly well adapted to serve as an
annex to a civil hospital, not only for the treatment of surgical
cases, but to meet the requirements of certain epidemics—cho-
lera for example, the mortality incident to which disease is
largely controlled by the general sanitary surroundings; and
this fact was never more strikingly illustrated than in the
Crimea, in the very first large tent-hospital ever established.

OF THE AMERICAN
AMBULANCE.
"The benefit of a discovery extendcth to the whole race of man; that of a civil
or political reform, only to a particular place. The latter lasteth not beyond a few
ages, the former through all time. Moreover, the reformation of a State in civil
matters is seldom brought about without violence and confusion; whereas discoveries
carry blessings with them and confer benefits without causing harm or sorrow to
any."—Bacoh.

T is particularly in times of war that the necessity
for military hospitals becomes apparent. To
meet this special and immediate necessity it has
been the custom to organize hospitals on a tem-
porary footing, and to such hospitals most of the
sick and wounded of armies have been taken. The welfare and
comfort of the sick and wounded, and the chances of their re-
covery, have always depended in a large measure upon the
suitableness and excellence of these provisional establishments.
No law of sanitary science is more absolute than one which may
be formulated as follows: The ratio of the mortality among me?i,
whether sick or wounded, invariably increases in proportion as the
respirable air in the apartment or place in which they are sheltered
differs in its composition from the mass of the atmosphere at large.
This general proposition is a practical one—it is fundamental—
the whole subject of hospitalization rests upon it. Indeed, since
many years its importance has been recognized in the construction
of civil hospitals, and it has also been regarded in the construc-
tion and disposition of permanent and sedentary military hospitals
as well.
Unfortunately, however, the idea has been very commonly
entertained that it was impossible to realize in temporary held hos-
pitals those conditions now generally considered indispensable in
more permanent establishments. This idea was not entertained
<pb>
by the American International Sanitary Committee, which was
founded in Paris immediately on the declaration of war in 1870;
on the contrary, their belief was that temporary field hospitals
offering all the shelter necessary in the treatment of the sick,
and at the same time permitting that abundant ventilation which
experience has taught us is so important, particularly in the
treatment of the wounded, could be easily and cheaply estab-
lished. They also believed that the forced transportation of
the wounded long distances was often prejudicial in the extreme,
as well as costly and unnecessary, and that the welfare of the
wounded and the welfare of the army—that the interests of hu-
manity and science alike—could, in principle, be protected best
by sending the hospital to the soldier, rather than the soldier to
the hospital.
At the very first meeting of the Committee it was "Resolved:
That this committee organize a field hospital for the treatment of
the wounded, which may serve as a public expression of their
opinion with regard to the requirements of such an establish-
ment." It was also "Resolved: That this hospital be established
under American tents;" such tents, in the belief of the com-
mittee, having been already proved to be especially and most
admirably adapted to the hospitalization of the sick and wounded
on the field, while promising with a proper organization a still
wider application in the construction of sedentary army hos-
pitals.
Circumstances of expediency, which have been elsewhere stated,
induced the committee to fix their experimental hospital at Paris,
where to the writer of this Report was finally entrusted its imme-
diate organization. A location had been selected on the avenue
de lTmperatrice, No. 36, and several of the tents erected, on
the first day of September, 1870. From this date until the close
of the siege, tents, tent-barracks, offices, and establishments of
various kinds were added as necessity required, or as increased
pecuniary resources enabled us to enlarge the hospital. Thus,
when we began our work, it was proposed to establish a "tent-
hospital" containing about forty beds, but on the 1st of January
we had so enlarged upon our original plan as to be able to report
to the Intendance one hundred and fifty beds, occupied and un-
<pb>
occupied, sixty of which were in tent-barracks that we had
constructed upon the ground, or in tents which, liberated by
the construction of these barracks, from services connected with
the administration, could be attached to our wards.
It will be seen from this statement that the Ambulance was
from time to time so changed in its appearance, as a consequence
of development and growth, that a description of it made at any
time much before the close of the siege would be necessarily im-
perfect. I shall consequently describe it as it existed at that
time. My general description will be brief, particularly as an
engraving accompanying this Report (and which serves as a
frontispiece to this volume) will give a much better general idea
of the appearance of the Ambulance than it would be possible for
me to convey by a verbal statement, while most of the details of
the installation may be seen and easily understood by consulting
plate I. (Appendix), which exhibits a ground plan of the Ambu-
lance.
 
HE first impression produced upon a visitor, on arriving
at the American Ambulance, was generally one of sur-
prise. It was difficult for a person only familiar with
the hospitals of Paris and the ambulances organized in the
city during the siege—nearly all established in monumental
public buildings, or in hotels and private residences—to under-
stand how such a collection of tents and barracks, as we had
erected on the avenue de l'lmperatrice, could be made to serve
as an ambulance. And yet the first impression made upon the
visitor was almost always an agreeable one. The white tents in
the square, enclosed by long white-roofed barracks, the bright-
coloured awnings of the barracks and tent vestibules, the gravelled
walks, the grass plots and the beds of flowers, the little grove on
<pb>
the right, and the fir-trees planted in the central portion of the
grounds, formed in their ensemble a pleasing picture—one that
failed at least to bring to mind those unpleasant associa-
tions so frequently awakened when we pass by the gates of
hospitals which have had long histories, and which somehow
always seem to stand in the heart of great cities rather like
sombre fortresses, in which generation after generation is ex-
pected to make its final struggle for existence, than as houses of
charity, pity, and succour. We intended that our ambulance
should always look bright and cheerful, not only to our occa-
sional visitors, but to the wounded who might be the subjects of
our care; and I believe all who may have seen it will be ready
to admit that we were very successful in the execution of this
purpose.
On entering the grounds by the gate that opened upon the
avenue, and passing the sentry-box to the left, the first building
which usually attracted attention—as it was nearest the gate—
was known to us as the "Administration." It contained two
apartments—a recej)tion room for visitors, and a committee
room. But the tents were, of course, always the chief objects of
interest; and accordingly we commonly conducted our visitor
almost immediately to the pavilion nearest to the administration.
Generally before reaching this pavilion, however, our visitor had
had time to ask many questions—how the rain was kept out of it
in stormy weather, and how the tents were kept warm and com-
fortable when it was cold, &c., &c.? And this led us frequently
to speak of the qualities of the material of which the American
tents were made, of the uses of the double roof or "fly," of
the special system of heating that had been adopted, and of
many subjects considered at length in another section of
this Report. The pavilion, which we are presumed to be now
examining, was formed by joining together, end to end, five
United States' regulation hospital tents. It was 80 feet long,
including the vestibules attached to each end, and covered an
area of nearly 1,200 square feet. Each hospital tent was con-
sidered sufficiently large for six camp bedsteads; but while
several tents contained this number others did not, the reserved
spaces being filled with tables, buffets, and other articles of furni-
<pb>
ture. Thus, in this pavilion, there were never more than twenty-
six beds, although there was room within it quite sufficient for
thirty beds.
The iron bedsteads used by us, although made in Paris, were
exact copies of those so extensively employed by the Medical De-
partment of the United States Government during the War of the
Rebellion. Upon each of these bedsteads were placed a mattress
(a bed-sac filled with seaweed), a pillow filled with seaweed or
crin vigetal (moss of the live oak, Tillandsia), simple linen sheets,
and a sufficient number of blankets. Each bed was numbered,
and by the side of each was a table, or a chair, and a necessaire,
for the toilet articles belonging to the patient.
The tents were all floored, and several of them were neatly
carpeted. Opening one into the other, they were warmed by a
single furnace, the heat from which was thrown into the tents
through registers placed at intervals in the floor.
Leaving these tents by the rear vestibule, which served as a
closet for the vessels in daily use in the pavilion, but which had
been erected principally—as were also all the vestibules placed
in front of the doors opening into the wards—for the purpose of
preventing a too direct admission of cold air at every opening of
the door, we come to the tent barrack known in the Ambulance
as No. 4, and indicated on the Ground Plan by the figure 7.
This pavilion was made after the type or model adopted for all
the buildings intended to supplement the tents. A light frame-
work was planted in the ground having a height of nine feet from
the ground to the roof, with a width of about seventeen feet—its
length depended upon the room we wished to obtain. The
sides of the frame-work were covered with boards, from the
ground up to within eighteen inches of the eaves; from this
point to the eaves the covering was of canvas only. Doors
and windows were inserted in convenient places, and a floor was
laid upon string pieces resting upon the ground. Over the
whole construction was now thrown a double canvas covering,
which, supported by light rafters, formed the roof. The roof
projected over the sides of the building about two feet; the
canvas covering being turned under the projecting edge, to which
it was securely attached by a blue and red hanging border, that
<pb>
served at the same time as an awning. A tent-barrack con-
structed in this way was divided into rooms, according to the
requirements of the service, the division being effected either
by a wooden partition or by a simple curtain, as in the case
might be thought best. The finish given to the room, as well as
the character and quality of the furniture in it, depended upon
the use to which the room was to be put. In the administration
rooms, as also in all the bureaux and salons, the walls were
covered with hangings, and the floors carpeted, while a canvas
screen was used as a ceiling, for the double purpose of
hiding the nakedness of the rafters overhead, and effecting an
economy in the consumption of fuel.
Pavilion No. 7 was sixty-six feet long, and contained—
1st. An operating room, having a southern exposure, and well
lighted. 2nd. A ward, containing twelve beds, and such furni-
ture as I have before described. That the air-space might
not be reduced, this ward was without a ceiling overhead,
in which respect it resembled our second and largest tent-barrack
ward. It was warmed by a common coal-burning stove. 3rd.
A store-room, used as a wine closet. Two vestibules, covered
with red, white, and blue canvas, were erected for this pavilion
—one before the door leading into the operating room, the other
before the door leading into the ward.
Pavilion No. 8, fronting upon the central court of the ambu-
lance, was seventy-eight feet long, and resembled No. 7 in
external construction, except in having a somewhat greater pro-
jection of its roof, intended to protect a side walk which was laid
on the ground on the side fronting the court, the whole length of
the building. This pavilion contained—1st. A servants' salle a
manger. 2nd. The kitchen, in which were placed two cooking ranges,
and two large boilers, as also a number of tables, buffets, shelves,
&c. 3rd. The salle a manger for the surgical staff and their
associates. 4th. A surgical-staff bureau, and 5th. The pharmacy.
This little apartment was furnished with the necessary special
furniture, and besides containing the drugs and medicines, for
which fortunately we had little use, was used as the store-room
for most of our surgical apparatus. A covered passage way
separated Pavilion No. 7 from the next pavilion (marked upon
<pb>
the Ground Plan by the figure 10). This construction—No. 10
—was the largest upon the ground, being over one hundred and
thirty feet in length, and contained—1st. A linen room, which
opened upon the passage-way. 2nd. An office, opening also upon
the passage way. This office was occupied by the superintendent
of the linen room, and was used also as a drawing room by the
lady volunteer nurses. 3rd. A provision room. 4th. A ward, in
which were placed twenty-five beds. Although this ward, known
as "No. 5," contained a smaller number of beds than either of the
tent pavilions, covering as it did a superficial area of 1,557
square feet, the interior cubic space was much greater than in
any other one of the wards. It was furnished precisely as were
the other wards, except in having been heated by two stoves so
arranged as to contribute to the ventilation of the apartment, in
accordance with a modification of the Peclet system introduced
into American barrack hospitals by Dr. W. H. Hammond.1
Leaving this pavilion, we come to "ward No. 1," formed by a
series of six regulation hospital tents, and arranged both exter-
nally and internally as the tents of the first series already de-
scribed. A plank walk, passing to the left of these tents, led from
the court of the ambulance to a small grove, nearly in the centre
of which the latrines were established. Continuing in the same
direction, we come to the first of a series of four constructions
occupying the eastern side of the ground. This building was
small and contained but two rooms; in one all the soiled linen
coming from the wards was placed and arranged before being
sent to the laundry ; the other was used as a dead-house. The
second construction was much larger and contained three
rooms, one used as a store-house for articles in bulk; another,
provided with shelves, racks, &c., served as a depository for guns,
knapsacks, clothing, and other effects of the inmates of the ambu-
lance; the third room was the salon or drawing-room of the
aids volunteer. As the gentlemen who had offered us their
voluntary aid in the service of our ambulance waggons were com-
pelled to pass a considerable part of each day at the ambulance,
1 Peclet, "Nouveaux documents relatifs au Chauffage et a la Ventilation." Paris,
1854, p. 88.
<pb>
in order to be able to respond promptly to any call that might
be made upon us, either for waggons, stretchers, or stretcher-
bearers, it became necessary to provide them with suitable
quarters. The apartment given to them was one of the largest
in the ambulance, and the aids volunteer themselves so furnished
it as to make it by far the handsomest and most attractive. The
third building was erected to serve as a stable and a shed; the
stable contained seven stalls—four for horses, and three for our
cows; the shed, open on the front, was sufficiently large to
shelter four or five carriages. A fourth building—a dormitory
for the hired male nurses, completed this series of constructions,
which extended to the avenue de l'lmperatrice.
Between the stables and the administration, and bounded on
the one side by the tent-pavilions, and on the other by the avenue
de l'lmperatrice, was an open space, the front yard, if I may so
call it, of the ambulance. Several of our waggons were generally
stationed upon the part near the stable; here also our coffee-
waggon stood, under the shelter of a kiosk, in the centre of a
small garden. Two flagstaffs had also been erected upon this
portion of the ground ; one near the avenue supported, quite a
hundred feet aloft, an immense "red-cross" flag; the other, less
lofty, bore an American flag until long after the close of the siege
Not far from the middle of this space stood a circular tent occupied
by the chef de service. Passing to the right, on to the walk lead-
ing from the gate to the court of the ambulance, we come to a
large round tent, nearly thirty feet in diameter, standing almost in
the centre of the encampment. This tent contained ten beds,
and was reserved for the treatment of wounded officers. It waa
furnished with a vestibule, was supplied with water, was heated
by a stove, and provided with tables, buffets, chairs, &c., but
aside from its size and special use, and that it differed from the
square tents in being unprovided with a double roof, it represented
no principle of interest or value not elsewhere shown. Upon
the side of the ambulance bordering upon the rue Villejust, were
two small buildings which stood side by side; one sheltered and
protected a hydrant and filter; the other was used as a bucket and
hose-room. A water supply had been secured for each pavilion,
by a series of pipes communicating with the hydrant, but the com-
<pb>
bustible materials of which the ambulance was constructed, and
the serious consequences that might be apprehended from a fire,
rendered it expedient to take unusual precautions against such a
calamity.
It will be observed, that the five wards we are presumed to have
visited, contained an aggregate of just one hundred beds. Our
"field hospital," in a word, was capable of receiving 100 wounded,
and was supplied as well with all the accessory offices necessary
to a complete and independent hospital. As the limited extent
of the grounds rendered it inexpedient to attempt to treat in
tents, or tent-barracks erected upon them, a number of wounded
exceeding 100, we therefore—when we found, in the month of
December, that it was quite possible and, as it also seemed, desir-
able, to extend our work—attached to the ambulance as a de-
pendency a large house in the immediate vicinity. In this
house, No. 27, avenue de l'lmperatrice, were placed fifty beds,
many of which were reserved for the use of those who might be
brought in from the field but "slightly wounded," while a con-
siderable number always furnished us with the means of providing
for such convalescents as we wished to keep under our own
care and direction, until their health might be fully re-established.
The American ambulance was therefore really composed of a
"tent hospital," a "tent-barrack hospital" and "a house con-
verted into an hospital," and which contained altogether the
one hundred and fifty beds which we were able to place at the dis-
position of the " In tendance."
I may remark, however, that although special circumstances
gave to the ambulance many of the features of a sedentary
hospital, it was always essentially a sedentary ambulance—that is
to say, the house and the barracks were never considered as other
than mere dependences of the tents, which always held the post
of honour, not only topographically, but from the higher hygienic
importance attached to them. If the tents were fixed, and re-
mained six months upon the same spot, it was simply a necessity
which resulted from the investment of the city. Had the siege
been raised—had the French army been able to leave Paris, our
ambulance would have been able to follow. It became a seden-
tary ambulance, therefore, by the force of attendant circum-
<pb>
stances, but never at any time lost its essential and distinct
character of a field hospital. Nearly the whole value of its
history depends upon this fact being clearly and perfectly
understood.
I believe I have alluded in this brief description to nearly
every construction in the ambulance, which would be likely to
interest the common visitor. I have also thought it best in this
general way to introduce a more comprehensive account of its
organization, an account which shall give its history as an ex-
ponent of certain principles of hygiene, and indicate the value
of the material measures employed by me to put those principles
into practice.
 
||fp$!F the American ambulance during the siege of Paris
<s^l» awakened the liveliest interest among those who visited
it, if before the close of the siege it became more ex-
tensively, certainly more favourably, known than any other
ambulance in Paris, it was not so much because it was re-
garded as an expression of international sympathy and good
will, as because it represented a system of ambulance construc-
tion unlike in many respects any that had ever before been
employed. At the American ambulance it had been proposed
to erect a number of tents, and there, under such shelter as can-
vas alone might afford, to treat the wounded who might be
brought from the field. And this system had been proposed, not
from any want of buildings nominally suitable for hospital pur-
poses, but from the conviction that tents were better fitted for
the treatment of the wounded, than more permanent construc-
tions, not only in mild climates, or during the warmer portions
of the year in central Europe, but alike in winter and in summer
in all temperate latitudes.
<pb>
If I have said that the system proposed and finally adopted at
the American ambulance was one unlike in many respects any
ever before employed, this statement is so important that I can-
not leave it without explanation and support. I have certainly
not wished to say that at our ambulance tents were for the first
time employed in Europe or elsewhere to give shelter to the
sick and wounded, nor did I intend to convey the idea that they
had not occasionally been so used in armies at all seasons of the
year.
Since the time of Louis XIV., tents have been regarded as
more or less indispensable in most European armies. They have
served at times both in summer and in winter to give shelter to
troops in the field, and have occasionally been used for the
hospitalization of the sick and wounded when other shelter could
not be procured ; but when other shelter could be obtained for
the sick it has almost always been employed in preference.
The first establishment of what may properly be called "a
tent hospital," of which we have any exact and scientific ac-
count, was made at Varna, in 1855,1 and as the results were
unexpectedly good, and have obtained some notoriety, several
writers who have recently spoken of hospitalization under tents
have referred to that installation, not only as the first, but as one
established with a clear understanding even of the principles
which the American ambulance was intended to represent.
M. Michel Levy, however, under whose direction the ambulance
at Varna was organized, says:—" From the month of June the
increased number of our sick (mostly cholera patients) compelled
us to treat a part of them in tents." Referring in 1862 to the
1 This statement, which I make on the authority of MM. Levy, Chantreuil, Le
Fort, and others, is perhaps not strictly correct. Scrive says that in accordance
with a letter addressed hy him to the Intendance of the army on the 19th of July,
advising the establishment of tent-hospitals, on the following day " the principle of
hospitalization under canvas was consecrated by the installation in the open country
of a great hospital under tents upon the elevated plateau of Franka, about seven
miles from the city. A convalescent depot of similar organization was at the same
time established upon the plateau of Schiferlick. This new kind of hospital, attended
with complete success, suggested the idea of establishing similar camp-hospitals at
Varna for the cholera patients themselves."—Scbive, Relation Midico-Chirurgicale
de la Campagne d'Orient, pp. 70, 71.
<pb>
"good results" of this measure, he adds:—"The tent hospital,
as a permanent installation during the summer season, is a
novelty of the Crimean War," . . . and that, "with necessary
precaution and suitable weather (1'opportunity de la saison), the
treatment of the sick under tents is unattended with the risks
and inconveniences of overcrowding." 1
And he moreover has elsewhere said:—" As soon as the
weather grows cold, the tent becomes a shelter insufficient for
the sick, and not less liable to infection than shut-up barracks,
if it is closed almost hermetically, according to the custom of
soldiers; and it is even still more pernicious if the earth is
excavated within, en taupiniere, as was done in the Crimea."2
It will be observed from these passages that M. Levy considered
the advantages to be derived from the use of tent-hospitals as
necessarily limited by the circumstances of climate and season;
and such has been the opinion also of those French and German
writers who have since most earnestly advocated the open
air treatment of the sick. The apparent impossibility of
maintaining within tents during cold weather a comfortable
temperature has been accepted as a fact unquestionable, the
logical consequence of which has been the limitation of their use,
so far as possible, to the warmer months of the year. Scrive,
speaking of the use of tents during the siege of Sebastopol,
says :—" The tents, the only means of shelter for our hospital,
were insufficient to protect effectively against the cold our poor
sick, whose toes became frost-bitten, and whose feet even became
gangrenous almost without their perceiving it. It was truly a
deplorable spectacle; but where everything was wanting, what
material preventive was it possible to offer as a remedy for
these evils? Moral consolations, this was what medicine was
reduced to !"3 Testimony such as this, in the absence of any
rebutting testimony, could hardly be regarded as other than
decisive. It is not remarkable, therefore, that opinion in

<pb>
France on this subject should have commonly been expressed
as follows:—
"In those countries where we cannot make use of that precious
resource, abandoned houses, we are forced to establish the ambu-
lances under tents. But in the winter and in cold climates the
shelter furnished the wounded by the tissue of a tent is in-
sufficient."1
"The American hospital tent, very much simpler, and cer-
tainly less costly, than the English tent, is worthy of a serious
examination. For ambulance purposes it is greatly superior to
the French tent, and would seem to be perfectly suitable for the
establishment of temporary hospitals, during the milder portions
of the year (la belle saison)."3
"The simple tent is out of the question, the sick are suffocated
in it in the summer, and suffer from the cold during the winter.
The tents at the hospital in Frankfort are quite abandoned; one
our learned colleagues who visited that city last year in the month
of August found them empty, although there were in the hospital
many sick, who, according to theory, ought to have been in them.
Hospital tents and barracks realize much better the conditions
sought, but they also present certain noteworthy defects. They
are formed of absorbent materials which rapidly become infected
in spite of an abundant ventilation; they protect the sick incom-
pletely against variations of temperature, often sudden; it is
almost impossible to warm them, which it is frequently necessary
to do in April and October. If everything is shut up in order to
make the heating practicable, we have substantially only the
ward of an ordinary hospital." 3

It is only just to Dr. Sarrazin, the writer of this article, to say, that, attached as
surgeon-in-chief to the corps of General Ducrot, he was, during the siege of Paris,
one of our warmest friends, and that the interest he took in our experiment, and the
satisfaction he has often expressed in view of our results, are among the pleasant
remembrances which we all, of the American ambulance, shall not soon forget.

monograph upon the open-air treatment of the sick and wounded,
says:—" Unfortunately, hospitals under canvas can only be used
during the summer months." 1 M. Le Fort, an earnest advocate
of tent-hospitals, and the first person in France to seriously urge
their annexation to the hospitals of cities, for the treatment of
wounds, and certain diseases occurring among the civil popula-
tion, felt himself compelled to admit that "the tent is warmed
with difficulty, and it is scarcely possible to employ it during the
four or five winter months."2 "I think," he afterwards adds,
"that neither tents nor barracks should be employed except for
summer hospitals."
I cannot, however, more fairly represent recent European
opinion upon this subject than by quoting from the "Compte
Rendu" of an International commission appointed in 1867 for
the purpose of studying and reporting upon the ambulance
material placed on exhibition at the " Exposition Universelle."3
At the twenty-second meeting of this commission, the subject of
field hospitals having come up for discussion, the president, Baron
Mundy (a delegate from the Austrian War Department), said:—
"In my opinion, tents offer such inconveniences as to afford the
last kind of shelter (le dernier abri) to which we should have
recourse. Their dimensions are necessarily limited, on account
of the difficulties attending the transportation of very large tents,
and yet these are the only ones admissible. The ground upon
which the tent is pitched is a grave objection, on account of the
humidity which it retains and the emanations It exhales. Clean-
liness is here necessarily impossible, while ventilation is inevitably
defective. The consequence is that in such a place gangrene is
easily developed." Count Rohan-Chabot supported this state-
ment, and quoted to the same effect a passage from a publication
by Dr. Appia. Baron Mundy then spoke in favour of the em-
ployment of barrack-tents, such as had been used by Stromeyer
at Langensalza—a slight modification of the system proposed by
Vaidy in 1818, and by De Presle in 1769. The same subject

<pb>
being under discussion at the next meeting, Dr. Ring, the
delegate for Sweden and Norway asserted "that the worst
houses are preferable to tents." Count Serrurier, the Vice-
President of the General Commission of Delegates, was of the same
opinion. At the twenty-fourth meeting, the President concluded
some remarks upon modes of ventilating and heating field hos-
pitals, by affirming that it was useless to consider any methods
which might have been suggested for the warming of tents,
inasmuch as tents were completely unsuitable for the shelter of the
sick and wounded during the winter season.
And if evidence of an official character may carry with it more
of weight, I may add, that on the 3rd of June, 1868, the Prussian
Minister of War issued a circular which contains the following
passage :—" Not only is it unnecessary to make a floor in the tents
intended for the sick, since tents should be thus used only tempo-
rarily; but the floor is absolutely useless, and would be replaced
with advantage by a layer of sand well packed down, if there
should be any occasion to use the tent mare than four weeks."
The citations which I have made will very clearly indicate the
opinions held by the most eminent hygienists on the continent
of Europe concerning the employment of tents in the hospitaliza-
tion of the sick.
But I should by no means fairly present this subject without
making more than a general reference to the conclusions which
have been reached by those English sanitarians and medical
officers who also have been recently occupied with the questions
that relate to the best methods of obtaining quarters for the
sick of armies. Public hygiene is emphatically an English
science; and the principal advances that have been made in
modern times in the art of applying to populations those laws of
health which limit in a general way the rates of mortality and
disease have been founded largely upon English inquiries, and
have been secured to the world by the results of English
practice.
The importance of maintaining a pure atmosphere within
buildings or apartments occupied by numbers of men, whether
well or sick, may have been long since recognized ; but the first
practical measures for maintaining within such apartments a
<pb>
desired degree of atmospheric purity were adopted in England;
while from the time when Hales' clumsy machines were intro-
duced into some of the London hospitals until the present day,
ventilation and the various methods suggested for preventing
the evil consequences of impure air in hospitals, military as well
as civil, have been made a subject of the most careful in-
vestigation.
It was, however, only after the outbreak of the Crimean
War that the attention of English sanitarians was immediately
directed to a consideration of the best methods of hospital-
izing the sick of armies. Previously to that war, quarters had
generally been provided for the sick in British armies in ac-
cordance with those principles and that practice which I have
in the First Part of this Report spoken of as then common in
European camps. In one important respect, however, there
was a difference. Since a very long time it had been a practice
in the British army to maintain a regimental hospital or
infirmary. This was always practically an ambulance; it fol-
lowed the regiment in its movements, and as buildings were not
always accessible, it was occasionally established under one or
more tents. The practice of maintaining the regimental hos-
pital under canvas was indeed quite common some time before
the Crimean War. This war, opened while the season was still
pleasant, and conducted in a country almost totally destitute of
houses of any kind, led almost immediately to the hospitaliza-
tion of large numbers of men under tents. The hospitals so
established, it is true, were nearly all regimental, and were only
intended for the treatment of the slightly ill, or to shelter the
more serious cases previous to their removal to some general
hospital; nevertheless, this extensive use of tents of various
kinds for hospital purposes led to a serious investigation of the
merits and defects of tents when employed as a shelter for the
sick, and called forth an expression of opinions, as well official as
unofficial, of the very highest importance.
Occasionally the tents were spoken of as furnishing fairly good
quarters for the sick in pleasant weather, but they appear to have
been very generally considered as quite unfit for a winter
service.
<pb>
Assistant-Surgeon Wyatt, of the Coldstream Guards, reports
that:—" The tents have been found a most imperfect protection
from the rainy weather, the ground within being often con-
verted into a complete quagmire; and I do not consider the men
in their debilitated state will be enabled with safety to occupy
tents during a cold winter. I believe that if the sick are to be
treated during the approaching winter in a field hospital, some
kind of wooden hut will be absolutely necessary." 1
The Surgeon of the 41st Regiment says, writing in December,
1854:—" I have eight circular tents for the accommodation of
the sick, at this season of the year totally unfitted for their recep-
tion, as the weather side is never water-proof. To endeavour to
obviate this as well as the cold, I obtained old tents as coverings,
which in some measure answered the purpose; but, on the other
hand, they rendered the atmosphere so close that I am in doubt
which of the two evils is less injurious." 2
Dr. McKinnon, Surgeon of the 21st Royal North British
Fusiliers, says:—" In fine weather the shelter given by the
marquee is excellent, but these tents from their great size are
apt to be blown down. It is at all times a difficult matter to
preserve them from smell. They soon acquire a tainted odour,
which it is difficult to eradicate. It is also no easy matter to
regulate the ventilation; there is either too much or too little
ventilation."3
To certain "Queries contained in the Director-General's circu-
lar letter of June 30th, 1856," Sir John Hall replies as follows:—
"Question 7: Best method of sheltering wounded after an
action?
"Answer: Houses, if they can be obtained, are the best shelter
for wounded, but where they are unattainable, hospital marquees
answer very well.
"It may even be necessary to resort to the common bell-tent,
for want of better accommodation; on service it is not always
what is best, but what is available at the time, that must be
used."
1 "Medical and Surgical History of the British Army." London, 1858; vol. i.
« Ibid. 3 Ibid. p. 212.
<pb>
"Question 20: What description of shelter, in the absence of
houses, is best for soldiers and sick, when required to remain
stationary during the winter, &c.?
"Answer: Huts, either wooden or wattle and dab.
"When tents are used in winter they should be double, and
have a ventilator in the top." 1
Similar quotations might be multiplied almost indefinitely
from the several Parliamentary Reports which were published
upon the Crimean War. It will be observed that, while the objec-
tions to the employment of tents, particularly in the winter, are
very clearly stated, one of the best authorities on sanitary sub-
jects, although giving a preference to houses, yet affirms that
"hospital marquees answer very well" for sheltering the
wounded; and he even goes so far as to suggest that they may
be used in the organization of stationary hospitals, and that even
in the winter time.
This opinion was doubtless founded principally upon the then
recent experience of a considerable number of regimental sur-
geons, who had treated their sick in hospital marquees during the
two preceding winters with fair success. Nevertheless, the ge-
neral verdict was that some sort of wooden hut was indispensable
to the organization of a stationary field-hospital under the best
conditions; and it is well known that, after the first winter
before Sebastopol, the field and division hospitals, as well as
most of the regimental hospitals, were established in barracks.
The various reports upon these barrack hospitals and the state-
ments of the plans devised to secure the best sanitary conditions
within them, which have in England since emanated as well from
individual observers as from official committees of inquiry, have
presented the general principles to be observed in the construc-
tion of military hospitals in the most complete and exhaustive
manner. And no one can fail to remark, in examining the more
recent writings of those investigators who have made the health
of armies a special study, an increasing disposition to regard with
favour a hospitalization of the sick which shall secure, to the
1 Op. cit. vol. i. pp. 498-503.
<pb>
largest extent practicable, the benefits of a constant and unlimited
supply of air.
Dr. Parkes, in his work on hygiene, says:—" Both regimental
and division hospitals move with the force, and are best made of
tents. It is now quite certain that good, well-ventilated tents
are much better than any buildings which can be got.
"In the rear of the army is the field general hospital. The
Austrian experience seems to be in favour of making it of tents,
moving it up with the army. It must be of great advantage to
have it made of tents ; they have all the advantage of separate
houses, both as to ventilation and separation of patients ; have
excellent ventilation, if well made ; can be shifted from ground
to ground or place to place ; erysipelas and hospital gangrene
are extremely rare in them.
"In rear again of the field general hospital other hospitals
must be organized. ... It seems now quite clear that these
hospitals should not be the ordinary buildings of the country
organized as hospitals. Such a measure seldom succeeds, and
the mere adaptation is expensive, though probably always im-
perfect. Churches should never be taken, as they are not only
cold, but often damp, and there are often exhalations from vaults.
The French ( ?), Austrian, and American experience is in favour
of having the hospitals in rear made of tents or wooden huts.
The huts are perhaps the best, especially if the winter be cold."
In conclusion, he says :—" To sum up the hygiene of field hos-
pitals in war. The movable field hospitals (regimental, division, and
general in rear) to be made of tents; the tents being well construc-
ted, of good size, thoroughly ventilated, the flaps being able to be
raised so as almost, if desired, to make the tent into an awning.
The stationary general hospital in rear should be of tents or
wooden huts, but never of con verted buildings or of hospitals used
by other nations." 1 Dr. Parkes has in "the passages which I
have quoted recommended, quite without qualification, the em-
ployment of tents in the construction of "hospitals in war." It
1 "Practical Hygiene.'' Dr. Parkes. John Churchill, London, 1864; pp.
632, 633, 635.
<pb>
should not be forgotten, however, that since a long time it has
been the custom in the British service to issue tents to expedi-
tionary corps in numbers sufficient at least for the presumed
needs of the regimental hospital. With regard to the establish-
ment of a field general hospital under tents, Dr. Parkes would
seem to think favourably of it on account of "the Austrian ex-
perience." This, it will be remembered, was an experience
limited to the summer months.
As he says not a word upon the subject of warming tents, the
natural inference is that his preference expressed for them would
be controlled by the circumstance of season even in temperate
climates, except possibly for the establishment of the regimental
infirmary. Indeed, for the organization of stationary hospitals,
this writer states that "huts are perhaps the best, especially if
the winter be cold." While condemning the custom of convert-
ing churches and other buildings into military hospitals, and re-
commending the employment of "tents or wooden huts" in the
construction of such establishments, Dr. Parkes has certainly
scarcely specified, with desirable precision, the conditions which,
in his opinion, should determine a choice of tents.
Although, in so far as it is my purpose to show that the experi-
ment made at the American ambulance was in several respects
quite a new one, I should confine myself to a presentation of
such opinions concerning the employment of tents in the hospi-
talization of the sick as were prevalent anterior to the war of
1870-71, the results of every new war in their relations to this
subject are of too much interest to be passed over in silence.
While, in the still existing absence of official and other trust-
worthy reports on the ambulance service as conducted during
the late war, it may be premature to affirm that neither in
France nor in Germany was the use of hospital tents then regarded
with more favour than formerly, it may be safely said, that in no
instance were they selected for the organization of a permanent
hospital where , a sufficient number of so-called suitable houses
or barracks could be obtained.1
1 I except, in making this statement, the ambulance established in the Garden of the
Luxembourg, after the close of the siege of Paris, under the direction of Dr. Depaul, and
<pb>
Probably the most extensive tent hospital organized by the
French during the war was that at Metz; at least, this hospital
had a less transient character than several which were only
established to respond to some special emergency.
The following extract will show how this establishment was
regarded, and the conclusion its history was presumed to teach :—
"At Metz the number of wounded had so increased, that it be-
came necessary to place on the Esplanade and the open gardens
adjoining 100 circular tents (tentes coniques), in each of which
were placed six or eight men selected from among the slightly
wounded.1 This hospital was one of the first it became neces-
sary to break up. Thus, hospital tents should be considered
only as a resource wholly extraordinary and provisional, suit-
able only for ambulances on the battle-field itself—des premieres
lignes—where the wounded may be placed during the action,
before their evacuation." 2
But a more detailed statement, as well as a more authoritative
opinion, is given by M. Grellois. "On the 15th of August,"
says this writer, "our beautiful promenade the Esplanade was
covered with tents, and had all the appearance of a camp. On
the 1st of September tents were also pitched in the Garden of
Boufflers. These two ambulances, in fact, formed but one ....
But the bad weather and the cold which penetrated the tents
forced us to suppress this double ambulance early in November.
.... Towards the middle of November the cold became so
severe under the tents (which still remained), that several cases
of frostbite of the feet, and of the toes especially, were seen."3
which, in the disposition of the pavilions, system of heating adopted, <fcc., was an
exact copy of the American Ambulance. M. Le Fort says (" La Chirurgie
Militaire," p. 182) :—" During the winter of 1870-71 the tent hospital attached to
the Hospital Cochin was utilized for the wounded of the siege," <fec. It was only,
however, after the capitulation of Paris, and after M. Le Fort had returned to the city,
that it was opened. In October, 1870, as soon as the weather became frosty, the
patients were removed and the tents closed.
1 According to M. Leplat's report, the number of tents pitched upon the Esplanade

M. Grellois says:—" The tents became so infected, as early as
the 21st of September, that it was a matter of urgency to repitch
on new ground as many as possible." But it is only remarkable
they did not become infected even earlier, from the account
which he gives of the surrounding sanitary conditions. "On
this day" (21st September), "I called attention to the extreme
filthiness that existed around the tents." The sick were lying
on the ground, the most hygienic plan according to M. Grellois 1
—four, six, and even eight under a tent—a common army tent,
and one totally unfitted for hospital purposes, except possibly
in warm and rainless weather. "But what aggravated the
situation was "—a circumstance which one would suppose impos-
sible in an army where the least discipline existed—" the tents
were filled at times with marauders, who, escaping the guards, and
in disregard of all authority, crawled into them during the night
to slip out at daybreak and recommence their life of vagabondage."
The straw was changed in these tents "as often as considera-
tions of economy permittedbut finally straw became so scarce
that it became necessary "to allow it to become infected." a
Notwithstanding the unfortunate circumstances enumerated,
the results appear to have been even more than satisfactory.
The surgeon in charge, M. Leplat, reports but 176 deaths among
5,500 treated for wounds as well as diseases. Relatively to the
number treated the mortality was small. M. Leplat observes:—
"We had hospital gangrene and purulent infection, as they were
everywhere; but these complications were only seen in cases of
extensive wounds or after capital operations. Hospital gangrene
seemed to yield readily to applications of perchloride of iron.
Never have we felt the ill effects of overcrowding; never did any febrile
affection take on the form of petechial typhus. Nor was any one of
the surgeons or nurses attached to the ambulance attacked by
this disease, the propagation of which among the personnel of
hospitals is unfortunately too common."3 And that full value may
1 "I have often heard the poor sick soldier complain while hpng upon the stratc.
It is perhaps, nevertheless, the most desirable as well aB the most hygienic kind of
bedding,where overcrowding may give rise to fears of infection." (Note, p. 203, op. cit.)

<pb>
be given to the final statements, it should be remarked that
typhus appeared with considerable severity in a number of the
hospital establishments of Metz during the siege.
But having presented the essential facts connected with the
tent ambulance organized at Metz, I will here reproduce the
leading conclusions which M. Grellois draws from the experiment.
"A hospital built of stone, well constructed according to
certain rules—according to certain forms and dispositions, interior
and exterior, determined by hygiene and the art of construction—
is assuredly the best asylum that one can offer to the sick and
wounded.
"Buildings exceptionally used as hospitals, having been con-
structed for other purposes, are generally defective. Neverthe-
less, there are many degrees between the good and the bad.
"I know not why certain hygienists reject in a general way
the dormitories attached to lyceums, boarding schools, and semi-
naries. A certain infatuation has lately taken possession of
physicians in favour of barrack hospitals. The results obtained
in America by this mode of hospitalization are seductive, I
confess, but they have not led me away. The army of the
United States was exempt from epidemics due to infection, and
the credit of this has been attributed to the practice of placing
the wounded in barracks. Had the wounded been placed in
good stone hospitals, would they have been less fortunate? I
do not know, but I think not.
"Barracks have but a single advantage ; it is an important one
—it is the rapidity with which they can be built.
"In the summer, barracks are disagreeable to live in; in the
winter they are utterly uninhabitable. The single board which
separates the inside from the outside is not a sufficient non-
conductor of heat. In cold weather the stoves are barely able to
maintain a supportable temperature even for those in their imme-
diate vicinity. The pine wood generally employed in these
constructions is one of the most hygrometric of woods; it imbibes
moisture and sweats it out within the barrack; it swells, and then
so contracts when it becomes dry as to leave openings between
the boards.
"The floor is subject to the same inconvenience, and opens
<pb>
passages to the wind from without, and to liquids from within
which soak into and contaminate the soil; and it makes little
difference in this respect whether the floor is laid directly upon
the ground or fifty centimetres above it, as was the case in the
pavilions erected at Metz.
"A roof made of boards is bad from every point of view. Is it
to be covered with zinc? It then becomes a good shelter against
rain, but it augments the inconveniences of the heat and of
the cold. With regard to infection—a matter that particularly
interests us—the barrack, however it may be constructed, is bad.
To resume, barrack your sick and wounded when you are forced
to, but be careful not to do it in bad weather.
"Tents have had and still have their warm partizans. These
people, I believe, have never inhabited a tent. As a very last
resort, or in some exceptional cases, I admit it; but this sort of
shelter, whether it be for well men or sick men, is very far from
having my sympathies. The inconveniences resulting from
atmospheric influences are felt to the very highest degree under
tents. Shall I point out the grave inconvenience occasioned by
the wind coming up in gusts under the canvas, and covering the
food with dust and everything it brings along with it?
"The tent is no less than the barrack subject to infection. The
canvas imbibes miasms with great facility, and the soil which it
covers is soon contaminated with morbific products of every
sort." 1
Such are the conclusions which M. Grellois draws from the
experiment at Metz!
A number of the ambulances organized at Paris by the
"Societe de Secours aux Blesses" were sent into the field pro-
vided with a few tents. These tents were designed to be used
on the field as a shelter while the first dressings were being
made, or, in case of an emergency, to be used as an annex to
some sedentary hospital. They were, however, not constructed
with reference to a winter service, and disappeared with the
coming of the first frosts. Nevertheless, it may be remarked
that M. Le Fort, who served as surgeon-in-chief of one of these
1 Op. cit. pp. 194, et seq.
<pb>
ambulances, does not hesitate to affirm that the tents answered
admirably so long as the season permitted them to be occupied.
In Germany, where the tent and tent-barrack system of hos-
pitalization was first applied in the summer of 1862, no serious
attempts have been made to use tents during the winter months.
The German tents are generally very large, heavy, and difficult
to transport, and tent-barracks have been thought to possess
most of their special advantages.
The common practice among the Germans during the late
war was to establish the field ambulances in the nearest build-
ings, from which the sick were evacuated to the rear as speedily
as possible. Tent hospitals were rarely employed except quite
in the rear of the active armies, and such hospitals were almost
without exception closed on the approach of winter, the sick
being transferred to buildings of various kinds, which had been
turned into hospitals, or to barracks constructed as described in
the First Part of this Report. Indeed, so far as I am able to
form an opinion from the reports which have come to me con-
cerning the German field hospital service during the late war,
there was a decided preference from the outset for some sort of
barrack, whenever a hospital was to be especially constructed.
The German army took the field almost wholly unprovided with
tents of any kind; and if unable to find houses suitable, or in
sufficient numbers to serve as a temporary shelter for the sick,
huts were constructed, in the most hasty manner, of rough
boards; they were often unprovided with windows, but were
capable of being opened on the sides all the way around by
means of louvres, or movable walls.
Where a more permanent establishment was proposed, either
tent-barracks were employed such as I have described in the
Second Part of this Report, or recourse was had to well-constructed
wooden barracks, similar in all their more essential characteristics
to those so extensively used in the United States during the War
of the Rebellion. In fact, Fischer, who has been one of the most
prominent German advocates of the open-air treatment of the
wounded, strongly urges the importance of using barracks and
barracks only, for sedentary hospitals :—" We can only commend
the barracks," he writes; "they possess in the summer all the
<pb>
advantages of tents; they are less hot within, and the ventilation
is much better; they protect the sick better in bad weather, and
they can be put up in a month or six weeks, which is the time
generally occupied in preparing for war." 1
Says Captain Galton :—" The want of suitable hospitals has led
to the erection of a large number of temporary buildings of
wood, as well as to the use of tents. Neuwied, Frankfort,
Mannheim, Heidelberg, Darmstadt, and Aachen, afford some
very good examples of hospital wards of this nature. In all
these the effect has been to give the patient as much fresh air as
possible. The sides are in many cases capable of being entirely
opened, and are so kept. Along the ridge is a very large space
devoted to the admission of air. Where the sides are continuous
and there are windows, a large opening for fresh air is reserved
along the eaves, and frequently along the floor. The floor is
raised from 2 ft. to 4 ft. off the ground. In a few cases only are
the arrangements for the removal of foul matter so perfect as
they should be. There are no doubt exceptions to this good
form of ward construction, but the general result will, I believe,
form an era in hospital building. I must, however, add, I saw
with regret some of the best being prepared for the winter in a
manner to prevent any access of fresh air. The surgeon of one
hospital at Mannheim said he would prefer to keep the
wounded in the open air till December, but that the nurses
would not stand the cold." *
It would be impossible to convey more clearly the genera]
German opinion, with regard to the expediency of placing the
wounded under a canvas shelter during the winter, than by
quoting the statement of Miss Lees:—" Also, I must add," says
she, "that whilst attention is paid to hygiene in France, so far
as my experience goes it seems to be ignored altogether in
Germany, where most military hospitals had double windows,
1 Fischer, quoted by Demoget and Brossard in "Etude sur la Construction des
Ambulances Temporaires." Paris, Alfred Cerf, 1871 ; p. 127.
2 "Report of the British National Society for Aid to the Sick and Wounded in
War." London, 1871; p. 58. Here is a case in which a hospital was avowedly,
and in spite of the preferences of the surgeon, fitted up for the nurses. The misfor-
tuno is that, nine times out of ten, the interests of the sick are thus sacrificed in
compliance with the wishes of these people.
<pb>
which in cold weather were never allowed to be opened (!), and
where, when they adopted the American wooden barrack system
(as at Berlin, Frankfort, Nancy, &c., for reserved lazarettes), they
carefully had all the windows nailed up at the commencement of
winter, leaving only one or two small ventilators movable at the
top of the building. At Nancy (where temporary wooden bar-
racks were erected, at an expense of 36,000 florins, for fevers and
contagious diseases) the air was so utterly foul and corrupt that
a feeling of utter nausea came over me each time I entered one
of them. Upon asking if they never opened any of the windows,
I received a look of indignation and surprise, and was answered,
'Of course we do; that is to say, the windows themselves are
nailed fast to prevent draughts; but there are ventilators in the
roof, and we open one or two of them every day for one and
sometimes even two hours' This was in February, and they
found it difficult to heat them to the degree which German
surgeons generally think necessary." 1
Admitting this statement to have been somewhat exaggerated,
any one, who is acquainted with the popular prejudices that
prevail in Germany and Northern Europe upon the subject of
draughts and cold air, will understand the many practical diffi-
culties in the way of conducting an experiment in hospitalization,
an essential condition of which is that an almost unlimited supply
of fresh air shall be given to the sick. In matters of hygiene
German theory is certainly greatly in advance of German prac-
tice. Theoretical considerations have determined the construc-
tion of numbers of tent-barracks and barracks, very admirably
arranged for the hospitalization of the sick. Such establishments
have been successfully used in the pleasant portions of the year;
but their employment in the winter has scarcely been regarded
with the favour one might expect from the excellence of the
plans adopted; and one of the principal reasons has been that,
with every means for obtaining an abundance of fresh air,
there has existed an exaggerated fear of the evil effects which
might result from its admission.
Barracks prepared for the winter as Captain Galton and Miss
1 Op. cit. p. 172.
<pb>
Lees have described are probably inferior even to common houses,
and there could be but little occasion to have recourse to them
except in the absence of such houses.
The British Aid Society chose to employ its vast resources
rather in aid of the hospitals established by the belligerents
than in attempting to organize hospitals of its own. In
fact, but one ambulance was sent out from England under
its direction. This, known as the "Woolwich Ambulance,"
was equipped in the most complete manner. Among an im-
mense quantity of stores were included "twelve hospital mar-
quees complete, with water-proof flooring, and twenty-one bell-
tents for personnel, officers, kitchen, and latrines." 1 But from
some cause, probably the lateness of the season, the tents never
appear to have been used. Indeed, the only allusion to these
tents the chief surgeon makes in his report, relates to a bell-tent
"of great service" as a lodging-place for the servants, and he
adds, "the only tent in the Prussian division " to which he was
attached.
If European opinion has, upon theoretical grounds, been un-
favourable to the establishment of tent hospitals during the cold
months of the year, European practice has furnished no example
within my knowledge of such an establishment, except it may
have been determined by the absolute impossibility of obtaining
other or sufficient shelter, and for the purpose of meeting an
immediate and temporary necessity.
In the United States, at the outbreak of the War of the
Rebellion in 1861, everything had to be provided for. The
Federal armies were about to operate in regions of the country
sparsely inhabited, where the shelter constructed was often
scarcely sufficient even for the necessities of the resident popula-
tion. To supply an anticipated deficiency of available permanent
shelter, tents were not only liberally issued to the troops, but
were given out with an equal liberality to meet the wants of the
medical service. To a regiment of 800 men three hospital tents
were allowed, each capable nominally of sheltering eight men,
while in addition each division surgeon had placed under his
1 Op. cit. p. 126.
<pb>
control a considerable number of reserved tents, for the purpose
of enabling him to establish a division hospital should it be
necessary.1 In addition to these liberal provisions in view of the
immediate necessities of the troops in the field, arrangements
were made for the establishment of "General Hospitals," on a
more permanent basis; during the first months of the war, in
large public and private buildings, and afterwards in wooden
pavilions or barracks.
During the winter of 1861-62, tents were not used, at least in
the army of the Potomac, except for the regimental hospital or
infirmary; in this hospital only the slightly sick were treated—
the severer cases being almost without exception transferred to
the division or general hospitals established in buildings at
Washington or in its vicinity. The regimental hospitals were
heated as a general rule by simple sheet-iron cylinder stoves,
the fuel used being wood; and the difficulty of maintaining a
comfortable and uniform temperature within them was a subject
of frequent complaint on the part of the attending surgeons.
Filling, as I did at the time mentioned, the office of an Inspector
for the United States Sanitary Commission, and having had
occasion in that capacity to visit the hospitals attached to more
than 100 regiments, I think I may say with truth that I never
heard the tent hospitals spoken of as other than most unsatis-
factory places within which to treat the sick. The discomfort
occasioned by the ever-fluctuating temperature within them was
an objection, at that time unmodified by any opinion based upon
a comparison of the mortality rates obtaining in tents and per-
manent hospitals, among those sick with the same diseases. It
was only after the opening of the Peninsular Campaign, in the
spring of 1862, that division and general field-hospitals under
tents were employed in the army of the Potomac. They soon
began to be favourably regarded, especially for the treatment of
the wounded, and were established at a number of convenient
points in the immediate vicinity of the field of military operations.
1 A division, in the Federal army, consisted of two or three brigades, and a
brigade of " two or more " regiments. The average full strength of a division may
be estimated at about 8,000—men and officers included.

One of the largest hospitals of this kind was organized by
Dr. John Swinburne at Savage Station on the 27th of June.
Over 2,500 wounded were there treated with most excellent results,
as compared with those obtained among the wounded of the same
army who had been "evacuated" into the general hospitals es-
tablished in buildings at Fortress Monroe and elsewhere.1 Again,
after the battle fought at Antietam, September 17th, 1862, a
considerable portion of the wounded, who were nearly 12,000 in
number, were treated under tents, with results much more satis-
factory than those obtained in the churches and farmhouses near
the field of battle, or in the sedentary hospitals at Hagarstown
and Frederick; and yet many of the tents were maintained, with-
out being provided with heating apparatus, throughout the month
of October and a part of November, until in fact nearly all the
wounded had been discharged as cured, or had so far recovered
as to be in a condition to be transferred to some convalescent
hospital. It should be observed that the weather, although at
times frosty during the months of October and November, was
at no time severely cold.
The only serious attempt made during the War of the Rebellion,
which I now remember, to treat the wounded under tents during
the winter season, was made in December, 1862. The army hav-
ing reached Fredericksburg, in anticipation of a battle, a large
number of tent hospitals had been established on the right bank
of the Rappahannock. After the unfortunate battle which oc-
curred on the 13th of December, most of the wounded were
brought immediately to these hospitals. The weather was very
severe, both cold and stormy; and the difficulty of keeping the
long tent pavilions properly warmed with stoves induced the
Medical Director to convey the wounded with the least possible
delay to the general military hospitals at Washington and Point
Lookout. Two weeks after the battle occurred nearly ten thou-
sand wounded had been thus transferred.2
1 Since this passage was written, Dr. Swinburne has informed me that tiie
hospital was established upon an old camping ground—a bad location—but that
he had no case of hospital disease, while gangrene and pyaemia were at this time
the causes of a large mortality in the hospitals in the rear, established in buildings.
* "History of the United States Sanitary Commission." Philadelphia, 1866;
p. 371.
<pb>
Several instances might doubtless be referred to in which
small tent-hospitals have either been established or maintained
during the winter season in the United States. It was generally
the case, however, that these establishments owed their exist-
ence either to the comparative mildness of the winter climate in
a considerable portion of the country, or to the impossibility of
obtaining near by what might have been considered better shelter.
To a few of the general military hospitals an annex of tents was
made, which was maintained all the year round; as, for example,
at the Lincoln Hospital in Washington. These tents were heated
with stoves during the winter, but they were almost invariably
reserved for cases which, for special reasons, it seemed desirable to
isolate. The results obtained in them, if satisfactory, never,
however, seem to have induced any one to suppose that during
the winter season the treatment of the sick and wounded in
general could be conducted more successfully, or even as success-
fully, under canvas, as within the wooden barracks of the general
military hospitals.
Indeed, one of the special characteristics of the tent-hospital in
the American army was its want of permanency. It suddenly
made its appearance on the eve of a battle, was maintained for a
few weeks until it had fulfilled its mission, and then, joining the
column of the army to which it was attached, reappeared, if
necessary, on some new field to render a like service.
In brief, American opinion, derived from the experience ob-
tained during the War of the Rebellion, may be expressed as
follows. The treatment of the wounded under tents during the
milder portions of the year is followed by the very best results;
cases of pyohemic poisoning are less likely to make their appear-
ance within them than even within wooden barracks, however
well constructed. During the colder portions of the year the
special advantages of tents are more than compensated for by
special disadvantages, such as render it generally expedient to
place both sick and wounded under the shelter of more perma-
nent constructions.1
1 If there were over two hundred permanent hospitals established, mostly in
wooden pavilions, constructed expressly to be occupied by the sick and wounded, the
<pb>
FEEL confident that the facts and the opinions, both
European and American, which I have presented, will
convince you that in proposing to establish an ambulance
under the shelter of canvas, not simply as a temporary, but, if ne-
cessary, as a permanent installation, we acted almost, if not entirely,
without precedent. And I believe you will be equally convinced
that the successful maintenance of our ambulance during the
whole period of an exceptionally cold winter in a besieged city,
where the general suffering from a want of fuel was even greater
than that occasioned by the want of food—where, subjected our-
selves to the supreme necessities of the siege, we were often forced
to see our fires go out without the possibility of renewing them—
has at least shown that, contrary to the common opinion, the use of
tents is not necessarily limited in temperate climates to a few
months in the year. I have said that our tent-hospital was es-
tablished on the avenue de l'lmperatrice, because we were con-
vinced that tents might be employed alike in winter and in summer
in all temperate latitudes. I also said something more—I said we
fact at first would seem to militate against the accuracy of my statement as regards
American opinion concerning the use of tents even in the summer months. But I
may hore observe that, while sanitary considerations are always of the greatest im-
portance in the construction of a hospital, motives of general convenience may often-
times determine the character of tho establishment.
Another reason which encouraged the creation of barrack-hospitals in the
United States, was the fact that, in a country abounding in lumber of every kind,
it was frequently found to be much cheaper to build a barrack than to buy a tent.
While having no reason to change my statement concerning American opinion
regarding the use of tent-hospitals, it is only justice to Dr. Wm. A. Hammond, to
whom, more than to any other man, the American army was indebted for its hospital
system to state that since these pages were written I have found in his work, "On
Hygiene," the general affirmation that "nothing is better for the sick and wounded,
winter and summer, than a tent or a ridge-ventilated hut."
<pb>
proposed to erect our tents, believing them to be better fitted at all
seasons of the year for the treatment of the wounded than more
permanent constructions. This evidently was the most important
part of our proposition; and whatever originality we may ever be
credited with, admitting our experiment to have succeeded, will
depend, first,—upon our having had the courage to refuse the
numerous convents, hotels, and palaces which were generously
placed at our disposition, and the audacity—if I may use so
forcible a word—to establish our ambulance for the winter under
canvas alone; and, secondly,—upon the means used to make our
establishment one suitable for the treatment of the wounded—so
suitable as to have been at the time warmly commended by
nearly all those who visited it, as also to have been pronounced
by the Governor of Paris "une ambulance modele."
In view of the many accidental and exceptional difficulties
incident to a siege, which were constantly embarrassing our
efforts, the results of the experiment have shown more com-
pletely than we had the right to expect the advantages which
may be gained by the treatment of the wounded under canvas at
all seasons of the year. While no ambulance or hospital existing
at Paris during the siege, in which any considerable number of
wounded were treated, escaped an invasion of hospitalism in some
one of its forms, the immunity from this evil was in ours so com-
plete as to have enabled our surgeon-in-chief to state in his
report:—"There have been no well-marked cases of pus-poison-
ing." He also reports that, having performed seven amputations
of the thigh, three were followed by complete recovery, and that:
—" Among the two hundred and forty-seven surgical cases treated
at the ambulance, there were one hundred and twenty-six cases of
compound fracture. Notwithstanding this great number of
fractures, and the causes prejudicial to health and convalescence
previously mentioned, only forty-seven, or a little over 19 per
cent., have died of their wounds." Certainly no better results
were obtained elsewhere in Paris.
Nevertheless, our success was not more remarkable than that
which may have been obtained by others who have preceded us in
the use of tents. M. Michel LeVy, speaking of the experiment at
Varna, says:—"While at the general hospital, from the 10th of
<pb>
July to the 18th of September, 1854, there were 1,389 deaths
among2,314cholera patients; that is to say, 100 deaths for every
166 sick; in the three tent-hospitals established at the same time,
there were but 698 deaths out of 2,635 cholera cases; that is to
say, 100 deaths for every 376 sick. During the time the cholera
patients were being treated in the tents not a single new case
occurred."1
Chantreuil, after having observed that it was quite impossible
to judge of the influence of tent hospitalization upon the wounded
in the Crimea, on account of the little time the wounded re-
mained under canvas—it having been the custom to evacuate
them as speedily as possible on to other hospitals—nevertheless
says:—" Quesnay and Pirogoff are in accord with M. LeVy in ad-
mitting that the accidents to which surgical cases are exposed
were less numerous in tents than in the hospitals, or even in
barracks."2
Chantreuil also refers to certain experiments made by Kraus in
Hungary. That writer, it would appear, reported in 1861 that he
had not only never seen a case of hospital gangrene developed in
a tent, but that the wounded attacked by this affection, when
placed under such shelter, rapidly recovered.
Says Dr. Hammond, in a work published during the War of the
American Rebellion, and while the author was Surgeon-General of
the Armies of the United States:—" It will, perhaps, not be out of
place again to insist on the great advantages of these temporary
field hospitals over those located in permanent buildings in
towns. Nothing is better for the sick and wounded, winter and
summer, than a tent or a ridge-ventilated hut. But in one in-
stance that has come to my knowledge has hospital gangrene
originated in a wooden pavilion hospital, and in no instance, as
far as I am aware, in a tent."3

speaking of air rendered impure by exhalations from the sick, observes that:—
"It is now well known that by the freest ventilation, i.e. by treating men in
tents or in the open air, hospital gangrene can be entirely avoided. The occurrence
of hospital gangrene in a tent is a matter of the rarest occurrence."—Practical
Hygiene, p. 100.

Fischer, Roze, Boerwindt, Stromeyer, and other German sur-
geons, have indicated the very excellent results obtained when
the wounded and those sick with typhus were treated in the
open air, or under the shelter of tent-barracks.1
Boerwindt had established at Frankfort-on-the-Main, in the
summer of 1866, three tent-barracks each containing fourteen beds.
These were occupied from the 22nd of July until the 2nd of
October by eighty-eight different patients, among whom were
fifty-three cases of wounds and thirty-one of typhus. During
this period of time four of the wounded died, while of those ill
with typhus three died, showing a mortality from wounds of
7'5 per cent., and from typhus of 9-6 per cent. Of forty-seven
cases of wounds implicating the bones, and occasioned by fire-arms,
forty-two recovered; and yet these cases were more than
usually grave. There were two wounds of the head, followed by
trephining; two penetrating wounds of the lungs; two of the
pelvis; two cases of excision of the shoulder, and two of the
elbow ; five wounds of the thigh, with lesions, more or less grave,
of the femur; two wounds of the knee-joint, with one excision;
nine wounds of the leg, with one amputation ; and finally, five
amputated—one a case of amputation of both thighs—who had
been removed from the hospitals of Obermain to the tents at
Frankfort.
Chantreuil very justly remarks :—" If we think of the gravity
of all these cases, of the miasmatic exhalations which must have
come from the liquids bathing the surfaces of these wounds, the
sloughs, and the dejections, one can understand how only an
abundantly renewed aeration could have prevented the forma-
tion of sources of infection; and when we see the success
obtained among these wounded, who seemed placed under cir-
cumstances the most unfavourable—the cures accomplished of
cases which the experience of ordinary hospitals would lead us
to consider as hopeless—one is almost forced to attribute the
difference in the result to the difference in the nosocomial
conditions." 2

The results obtained by Boerwindt were certainly very re-
markable, and were apparently even more conclusively in favour
of the open-air, tent, and tent-barrack treatment, than the results
obtained by us at the avenue de l'lmperatrice.
Two facts, however, must be considered in comparing our
results with those obtained elsewhere :—
1st. The respective general hygienic conditions to which the
inmates of the several ambulances were subjected.
Our surgeon-in-chief has himself very clearly pointed out in
his report the causes of disease which after the 1st of December
began to weigh heavily upon the whole population of Paris.
The army was especially exposed to these depressing influences,
which seriously diminished the probability of recovery in every
case, whether of disease or of wounds. It was at this time that
the mortality in the city of Paris rose from an average of 981
deaths per week, to an average of nearly 3,000 deaths per week,
a mortality rate which still rapidly rose until even after the close
of the siege. Dr. Swinburne says in his report:—"From the be-
ginning of the siege to the 30th of November above sixty wounded
men were treated; of these but two died, and the immediate cause
of their death was tetanus." If this statement is remarkable, it is
certainly not remarkable that as the general sanitary condition
of the city grew less tolerable our results became less favour-
able; that, in a word, when we closed our ambulance on the 26th
of March; 1871, we were compelled to acknowledge that our
mortality rate had amounted to over 19 per cent.1
', 1 The increase in the death-rate as the siege continued is strikingly evident in
the returns of nearly every ambulance. Thus in the ambulance established by the
Administration of the ambulances of the Press, in the Ecole des ponts et chaussees:
In September, 26 wounded were admitted with no deaths; in October, 35 were ad-
mitted with four deaths; in November, 93 were admitted with eight deaths; in
December, 45 were admitted with thirty-two deaths; in January, 77 were ad-
mitted with seventeen deaths; and in February, 2 were admitted with two deaths.
"In tho ambulance de la marine, in Paris, the rate of mortality among the wounded
increased in each of the periods into which the siege was divided. Thus in the
first, there were admitted 23 cases of wounds, of whom four died; in the second,
38, of whom eight died; and in the third, 41, of whom thirteen died; showing
clearly that here, as elsewhere, the rate of mortality underwent progressive increase
as the siege went on."

2nd. The period of time during which the ambulance or hos-
pital may have been maintained, and the results of treatment
subject to observation.
Mortality rates based on a month's experience at an ambu-
lance are evidently worthless; and yet there are surgeons who do
not hesitate to speak confidently of the results of treatment
after a period of observation thus limited. Boerwindt admits
that he lost four more of his patients after he removed them
from the tents. It is certain, therefore, if 9 per cent. represented
the rate of mortality which existed within his tent-barracks,
92 per cent. did not represent the rate of recovery; this
would range between 92 and 87 per cent., according as the
removal from the tent-barracks may or may not have acted as
the determining cause of death in the four last cases. The
American ambulance was in operation more than six months,
and no person reported "cured" died afterwards from his
wounds at the ambulance, nor has any such person since died
from his wounds elsewhere, within my knowledge.
A cause of great uncertainty in appreciating the statistics of
most ambulances and military hospitals is the pernicious prac-
tice of evacuating the sick from one to another. Of the 1,545
French soldiers who died after amputation of the thigh during
the Crimean War, nearly one-half died en route to some hospital,
and nearly the whole number died after having been "evacu-
ated." What a relief to certain hospitals—the elimination of
these frightful figures from their mortality records!
But the vitiating effect of this practice upon statistics is special
as well as general. For example: 436,144 cases (of wounds
and disease) were entered at the French hospitals during the
Crimean War. The losses of the army by death were 95,615;
deducting those killed in battle or who died before coming to the
hospitals, the deaths amounted to 80,639, or 18-50 per cent. of
the cases entered at the hospitals. But, says Chenu:—" The re-
ported number of cases entered does not represent the real
number of the wounded and sick, which did not exceed 225,000,
since many of them, taken first to an ambulance and thence
evacuated into one of the hospitals of the Bosporus, and from
thence to Gallipoli, Nagara, or even to France and Algiers,
<pb>
figured in the tables of every Iwspital establishment attached to the
army of the East." Now let us suppose a case: A hospital re-
ceives five soldiers wounded in such a way as to require in each
instance an excision of the head of the humerus; the five soldiers
are treated in this hospital during several weeks, at the end of
which time we will suppose them all to have died. The records
of this hospital would show the mortality after excisions of the
head of the humerus to have been 100 per cent. If, however,
these five cases had been so evacuated as to appear in the re-
cords of five different hospitals, although each case had proved
fatal, a consolidated report might show that there had been
twenty-five cases of excision of the head of the humerus, and but
five deaths; or, in other words, that the average mortality in
such cases had been 20 per cent.
The surgical statistics of the Crimean War published by the
English Government are among the most valuable with which I
am acquainted, and yet they are vitiated to a considerable
extent by the causes alluded to. Thus 12,094 wounded officers
and men were during the war received into the hospitals in the
Crimea; of these 1,840 died, or 15-2 per cent., and 3,573 were
invalided home; that is to say, 29-5 per cent. were sent home more
or less cured. Chenu expresses some curiosity to know what
may have been the mortality among this class of cases after they
were sent from the hospitals, a curiosity probably rather increased
than diminished by a statement made in an obscure foot-note
attached to one of the published tables, viz., "A very large pro-
portion invalided returned to duty subsequent to their arrival in
England." Of the 3,573 men sent home, "thirteen men and
three officers died on the passage;" but the statement is almost
incredible, that "only four deaths took place among men under
treatment for wounds in the general hospitals after their
arrival in this country," unless the proportion of these men who
reported themselves at the "general hospitals" for treatment
was relatively small.1
Indeed, it is far more difficult than one may at first suppose
1 ', Medical and Surgical History of the British Army during the War against.
Russia." London, 1858; vol. ii. pp. 259, 388, 389.
<pb>
to find in the records of military surgery statements of those
final results from which alone satisfactory conclusions can be
- drawn. Sometimes the period of observation has been too brief,
sometimes the evacuations have been so numerous as to invali-
date the tables ; and often these two causes of inexactness are
so combined as to render hospital statistics worthless in many
respects. Thus we are told that at the French military hospital
at Dolma Bagtche, 2,753 wounded were treated from the 1st of
May until the 1st of November, 1855; that 741, or 27 per cent.,
had died of their wounds before the 1st of November; and that
2,009 had left the hospital by " billet" or "evacuation" (73 per
cent.).1 Now this statement gives no idea of the proportion of
deaths and recoveries among the wounded;—741 had died before
the 1st of November; how many died afterwards? This is the
important question. It is as useless to tell us that the hospital
at Dolma Bagtche "offered conditions of salubrity more satis-
factory than several of the other hospitals near Constantinople,"
as it is to inform us that the wounds there treated were of more
than usual severity. These were conditions which doubtless in-
fluenced the results; but what were the results?
The ambulance opened at the " Corps Legislatif" on the 19th
of September, and closed on the 31st of January, 1871, was one
of the most successful ambulances in Paris. The total number of
the wounded treated there, during the four and a-half months it
remained open, was but 136, and the ambulance was closed about
the time the causes influencing the general health of the city had
reached their maximum development. In the rejjort of the Direc-
tor, published January 31st, 1871, twenty-one deaths are detailed,
showing a mortality rate of 15'5 per cent. Of those who had
been received at this ambulance, 115 are reported as " cured or
convalescent." An analysis of the "etat nominatif" annexed
to the report shows, however, that nearly all the 115 persons,
sent from this ambulance, were simply transferred in a condition
of more or less complete convalescence to some one of the
numerous ambulances of Paris.

Medecine," &c. Deuxieme aerie, vingt-deuxieme vol. Paris, 1858.

It is hardly necessary, except for the purpose of showing how
difficult it is to compare the results obtained in two ambulances,
even admitting the wounds in each to have presented an equal
gravity—that I should state that of the 136 wounded received at
the " Corps Legislatif," forty-five came "from other ambulances."
Now, what distinguishes the statistics of our ambulance, what
gives to them an especial value, is the fact that they relate to
cases under our care from their beginning to the end. We re-
ceived no wounded man from any ambulance, and we sent no
wounded man to any ambulance. Those who left our ambulance
left it either cured or dead.
Four amputations of the thigh had been made on or previously
to the 23rd of October; before the end of the following month
three of these cases might have been discharged as "cured." We
preferred, however, to retain them under our care four months
longer, until the closing of the ambulance, although, as every
surgeon knows, by so doing our statistics were in constant danger
of being seriously damaged.
In the almost complete absence of official reports from those
who may have had the direction of ambulances and hospitals
during the late war, it is impossible for me to establish many
comparisons between the results obtained in them and those
obtained by ourselves. It may be of interest, however, to make a
few additional comparisons, which, fortunately, I am able to do.
The ambulance "Rothschild" was opened at Paris early in
October, 1870; its hygienic conditions were exceptionally good:—
"A building erected the year before, but which had never been
occupied, was arranged in the following manner: On the ground-
floor were six large rooms containing fifty beds; on the second-
floor were twenty-five beds in twenty-five rooms, quite isolated
from each other; on the third floor were also twenty-five beds,
distributed as on the second. Arrangements were made that a
certain number of beds should always be vacant, that the bedding
might be aired, and overcrowding avoided." The hospital was
established on high ground near the Bois de Vincennes. "At
no time during the rigorous winter, notwithstanding the scarcity
of fuel, did the rooms cease to be suitably warmed by furnaces,
while the ventilation was as complete as could be wished." As
<pb>
for the kitchen, "by reason of our abundant supplies we were
able to furnish vegetables, both fresh and dried, long after they
were exhausted elsewhere." At this ambulance—certainly one
of the best in Paris—fifty-six wounded soldiers were treated
during the siege; of these ten are reported as having died of their
wounds—a mortality of 17-9 per cent. But several important
facts should be considered in appreciating this result. The wounds
were generally not severe. Thus, there were seven cases in
which the wounds were produced by fragments of shell, and all
recovered; indeed, four of these wounds were only contusions.
"Most of the severely wounded were kept at the central military
hospitals; from these were sent out to their dependent ambulances
those cases which seemed, in appearance at least, most transport-
able." Still four capital operations were performed—three
amputations of the arm, and one resection of the humerus; all
these operations resulted fatally. But the most remarkable
statement is the following:—" All the wounds involving the bones,
except of the fingers and toes, proved extremely grave; but two
thus wounded recovered. In one case there was only an erosion of
the external border of the humerus; in the other, a comminuted
fracture of the cubitus and radius."1 Of the ten deaths, eight
were ascribed to purulent infection; two were from tetanus.
An ambulance was established by the Administration of the
ambulances of the Press in the Ecole des ponts et chaussees—a
building containing nine large halls, fronting upon a garden and
a court-yard, with windows opening to the east and west, and
occupied by seventy-six beds. This ambulance was exclusively
devoted to surgical cases, and was under the immediate personal
direction of M. Demarquay, the surgeon-in-chief of the ambu-
lances of the Press. A special room was also here set apart for
M. Guerin, who was promising magnificent results from the
treatment of wounds by the occlusion of air—Vocclusion pneu-
matique. The ambulance received its first patient on the 24th
of September, 1870, and was closed on the 1st of February
following—a considerable number of the inmates having then
1 Dr. Job, '* Ambulance de l'Hopital Rothschild pendant le Siege de Paris, 1870-
1871." Delahaye, Paris.
<pb>
been transferred to the barrack-hospital at Passy. During this
period the ambulance received 281 wounded; of which number
63, or 22'4 per cent., had died—before the 1st of February.
Of sixteen wounds of the upper extremities, involving the bones,
thirteen proved fatal, and the immediate cause of death in each
case was attributed to pyasmia.1
In speaking of one of the ambulances of the Press, Dr. Gordon
says:—" There were thirty-five cases of wounds of the thigh; of
these, twenty-five simple, and no deaths; complicated, ten, and
ten deaths." And he observes, in commenting on wounds of
this class:—" In cases involving fracture of the femur, the
object sought to be attained was to preserve the limb; unfor-
tunately, however, the results—at least in hospitals and appro-
priated buildings—were little favourable, although, with the
advantages possessed by the American ambulance, the success
was relatively considerable."2
From the 19th of January to the 24th of June, 1871, there
were received into the barrack-hospital at Passy, 1,486 wounded;
of these 347 died, or 23-3 per cent.
These returns unquestionably represent very fairly the mor-
tality rates existing in the ambulances at Paris during the siege,
at least wherever severe wounds were treated. In several of
the large hospitals the death rates are said to have been much
higher than any here given. That they were so has never been
denied, and the evident anxiety to conceal the facts, in certain
instances which might be mentioned, furnishes us with all the
confirmation of the truth of the statements referred to, which is
practically necessary.
The "First ambulance" of the "Societe de Secours aux
Blesses" established a hospital at Metz on the 21st of August,
which was maintained until the 28th of October. "Of the 250
wounded there treated," says Surgeon Liegois, "ninety-six died
(38-4 per cent.); perhaps the number was greater, for when we
left we transferred eighty-three of the wounded to the military

hospital. As may be seen, the mortality in our little ambulance
was considerable—I shall even say frightful; but if I may judge
from the conversations I had with a great number of sur-
geons at Metz, it was not so great as that existing in many other
hospital establishments in that city. Among the causes of death
I shall mention first purulent infection. This cause carried off
three-fourths of our wounded; afterwards came dysentery,
diarrhoea, typhoid fever, gangrene, and tetanus."1
Dr. Gross informs us that during the siege of Strasbourg
(from the 12th of August to the 27th of September) 383
wounded men, women and children were received into the civil
hospital of that city; of this number 146 died of their wounds,
or 38'] 2 per cent.2 Among the men the mortality was 41'7 per
cent., among the women 403 per cent., and among the children
26-4 per cent. One of the immediate causes of death is said to
have been erysipelas, which, however, only made its appearance
towards the close of the siege, "when it attacked a considerable
number of the wounded." Septcemia was common:—"A large
number of my severely wounded," says Dr. Gross, " were speedily
taken off by acute poisoning of the blood. Eleven died of pyaemia."
Tetanus was observed four times, and resulted in three deaths.
The hospital in which the wounded were received offered
the ordinary conditions of a civil hospital, although at times
the wards were somewhat overcrowded. Two circumstances,
doubtless, contributed largely to the high rate of mortality in
this hospital. First,—The character of the wounds, which were
occasioned for the most part by shells, bombs, and shrapnels;
and, secondly,—The nervous excitement and moral depression
which resulted not only from the siege, but from the exposed
position of the hospital itself; this was struck no less than
thirty-eight times by shells, between the 23rd of August and the
27th of September.
In several important respects, however, the wounded in Stras-

bourg suffered less than those in Paris. While, as Dr. Gross
says, "the alimentation differed in no respect from that in
ordinary times," few of the wounded had been previously ex-
posed to the depressing influences of military service, and the
city capitulated before cold weather had begun to act upon the
general population as a predisposing as well as a direct cause of
mortality.
M. Stutel, in his " Histoire de l'Ambulance du petit Seminaire
de Strasbourg," 1 reports the entry at that establishment of 215
wounded, with fifty-two deaths, or a mortality rate of 24-2 per
cent.
The buildings occupied by this ambulance were of recent con-
struction, and the wards are said to have been large, airy, and
susceptible of an easy and abundant ventilation. "Food never
failed for a moment to be abundant—was ample during the whole
length of the siege." But here again the effects of the bombard-
ment were often painfully felt, and on one occasion compelled
the transfer of all the wounded to the cellars of the establish-
ment. Still, M. Stutel observes that:—" After this time the men
were in a certain way habituated to this kind of life," and there
was little evidence of any special nervous excitement or depres-
sion from the cause alluded to. "We had, nevertheless, and not-
withstanding our entirely exceptional hygienic conditions, to con-
tend against the most terrible complications of military surgery
—hospital gangrene, purulent and putrid infections." Out of
seventeen deaths which followed thirty-nine operations, fifteen
are attributed to these causes. Three cases of tetanus are also
reported, all having their habitual termination.
Says Dr. Gordon, in his "Lessons in Hygiene " :—u. During
the late war the general results of operations have been very
unfortunate; in some cases extremely so. Thus in one ambu-
lance within Paris, although the wounded had the advantage of
surgical skill of the highest order, the mortality numbered
fourteen out of fifteen operations, including excisions, resections,
and amputations; of these seven being primary with six deaths,
and eight secondary, all fatal. With regard to the mortality
1 "These pour le Doctorat en Medecine." Paris, 1872.
<pb>
elsewhere, we learn, from the reports of Ambulance No. 7, that
in twelve cases of operations, including amputations, resections,
and ligature, collected from Sedan, Balan, and Daigny, the
mortality was seven, or 63 per cent. At Beaugency, the rate of
mortality from operations of all kinds was 82-7 per cent.; at
Asfeld, of sixty operations, including amputations and resec-
tions, thirty-five were fatal, or a proportion of 58 per cent.; and
among the German wounded treated at the Chateau of Versailles,
out of seventy-five capital operations the deaths were fifty,
or 64 per cent.; the recoveries twenty-five. These rates of
mortality are no doubt extremely high, in some instances at
least higher than they were even in the hospitals of the Penin-
sular War; and it may be here observed, simply as a point of
comparison, that according to the statistics given by Mr.
Guthrie, of operations performed in those of Vittoria, Santander,
Bilboa, Passages, and Vera, out of 584 cases of capital opera-
tions there died 287, or 49 per cent. Thus it is much to be
feared that in this respect at least we have made relatively small
progress in the art of saving life." 1
It will be seen from these statements that the statistics of the
surgery of the late war quite justify the popular opinion which
prevailed in Paris during the siege, that recoveries were more fre-
quent in our ambulance than elsewhere. Dr. Gordon himself,
while deploring the high mortality rates which existed pretty
nearly everywhere, seems to dwell with no little satisfaction on
Dr. Swinburne's cases of conservative surgery, and concludes his
appreciation of our experiment in hospitalization by declaring
that:—" Within Paris we had, however, in the American ambu-
lance undoubtedly the most favourable results of any."2
1 Op. cit. p. 181.
s Surgeon-Major Wyatt, the colleague of Dr. Gordon in a special mission to the
French army, under orders from the English Secretary of State for War, and who
remained with Dr. Gordon in Paris during the siege, says, in a letter addressed to
Col. Loyd Lindsay, and dated November 7th, 1870, (see Report of British National
Society for Aid," p. 57): — "There has been as jet no proper military ambu-
lance constructed. The best model is that which the ingenious Americans display
here, but that is by no means perfect." Perfect—we never supposed it to be; the
best model — that is all we have ever claimed it to be.

HAVE elsewhere said that the ratio of the mortality
consequent on wounds in general invariably increases, in
proportion as the respirable air of the apartment or
locale in which the wounded are treated differs in its composi-
tion from the mass of the atmosphere at large. If most satisfac-
tory results have followed the treatment of the wounded and
sick in tent-hospitals, it has been principally because they are
more completely capable than any other hospitals of a constant
and natural ventilation. Formed of a tissue permeable to air
and gases, the vitiated air within them is constantly passing out,
and is constantly being renewed by fresh air, which enters not
only through certain openings, but passes freely through the
network of the covering itself. During a considerable portion of
the year the doors may be opened, and" the walls of the tent so
raised as to enable the patient to pass many hours of each day in
the open air. In the colder seasons, when it may be necessary
to warm the tents,' the air within them may be maintained even
more constantly pure ; since whenever the temperature of the
air within a tent is raised to a degree above that of the air with-
out, the air within the tent begins to escape, or rather is forced
into the surrounding atmosphere, from which in turn it is neces-
sarily renewed; and the rapidity of the outgoing and ingoing
currents of air will increase with the difference existing between
the temperature within the tent and the temperature of the
atmosphere at large.
This circulation is maintained partly through certain openings,
some of which in a tent it will be found difficult to perfectly
close. But (in my opinion) in cold weather, when the difference
between the interior and the exterior temperatures is from 30°
to 60° Fah., most of the vitiated air passes out through the
tissue of the tent. However this may be, it is certain that at
our ambulance, where we maintained a constant temperature of
<pb>
about 60° Fah. night and day—when we had fuel—the atmo-
sphere within the tents seemed to grow purer as the weather
became severe. Never at any time was a persistent odour to be
perceived in the tents, except that of tobacco smoke; and it
may be interesting to observe, that while this odour clung to the
tents during the mild days of the winter, it rapidly escaped when-
ever the weather was frosty.
I believe the greatest advantage, from a sanitary point of
view, to be derived from the general use of tents in the hospi-
talization of the sick and wounded, depends upon the facility
with which the atmosphere within them may be kept pure and
Wholesome, and the common results of overcrowding avoided.
Another very probable cause of the excellent results obtained
in tents may be attributed to the circumstance of their occupants
being constantly more or less exposed to the influences of
direct light. When the sick are treated in the open air the
influence of light upon them must be very considerable. How
important a factor this agent may be among the several known
to be indispensable, in order to have the best sanitary condition,
it is difficult to say. We know, however, that without light the
maintenance of health for any considerable time is impossible,
and that its invigorating effects upon organic life in general
bear a very constant relation to the directness or indirectness
with which the light may reach it. If it be true that the light
within a tent is not at any time, strictly speaking, direct sun
light, the light within a white cotton tent not only is in great
part direct light, but the light is stronger—the tent being in the
sunshine—than it generally is in any room receiving its light
indirectly, and by reflection, as nearly all rooms do. The light
of common rooms is also for the most part polarized light—light
which has acquired special and remarkable properties, and which
must exert an abnormal influence upon those who are constantly
exposed to its action.1
Tent-barracks, in common with tents, are capable of being easily
1 For facts and statements concerning the sanitary and physiological influence of
light, I would refer the reader to a very interesting little work by Dr. Forbes Win-
slow, entitled, " Light; its Influence on Life and Health."
<pb>
and naturally ventilated, and whatever reputation they may have
obtained, they owe almost entirely to this fact. While, how-
ever, the air within a tent-barrack during the summer season
may be kept as pure and free from odours of every kind as it
may be possible to keep it within a tent, such is not the case
during the winter. When the weather is cold and inclement, it
is necessary to keep the walls closed. Tent-barracks are heated
with stoves, and ventilation accomplished in connection with them,
by means similar to those employed in the wards of common
hospitals, is scarcely more complete.
The conditions under which the wounded were treated at our
ambulance differed in no essential respect from those existing in
the other ambulances at Paris, except in so far as the patients
were more directly exposed to the influence of the open air. The
food used by us was no better than that employed elsewhere;
the medicines were the same, and the surgical treatment was
essentially the same. It would be impossible to believe a priori
that a more or less constant and complete exposure of patients
to the open air should have no influence upon their health; that
the more direct exposure of our patients to the out-door air did
not unfavourably affect tbeir health, the surgeon's report abun-
dantly shows; indeed we all, who are familiar with the class of
cases treated, are well convinced that it powerfully contributed to
enable them to resist the depression occasioned by wounds, the
want of suitable food, and the epidemic influence which for seve-
ral months showed itself—less perhaps in an increased death-
rate from semi-pestilential forms of disease, than in the enfeebled
vitality and reduced powers of resistance exhibited by the whole
population of Paris.
<pb>
N the First and Second Parts of my Report I have had
occasion to notice, with some detail, many facts very
closely connected with the experiment made by us during
the winter of 1870-71. It remains, however, for me to speak
more at length of the general conditions under which the experi-
ment was conducted, of the principal material characteristics of
the ambulance, and of the arrangements special to it which I
believe to have had the greatest influence upon the results ob-
tained, or at least to be most worthy of notice.
Sanitary State of Paris.—Probably the most important
condition which affected the surgical history of the American
ambulance was the general sanitary state of Paris during the
whole period of its existence. The surgeon's report reveals no
fact more clearly than this; indeed, it is the only condition
between which and the surgical results it would be easy to prove
a direct connection, the influence upon these results of nearly
every one of the conditions special to the ambulance itself being
only more or less probable.
The sanitary condition of Paris had become bad when we
received our first patient, and it continued to grow worse rapidly,
until in the month of January, when we were treating the largest
number, it had become well-nigh pestilential. Improving slowly
during the months of February and March, when the ambulance
was closed, March 26th, the mortality among the general popula-
tion was nearly three times greater than usual.
The average number of deaths in Paris for the week ending
on the 11th of September, during a period of five years, the four
years preceding, and the year following 1870, was 889. For the
week ending on the 11th of September, 1870, it was 981. The
excess over the average was wholly owing, however, to an epidemic
of small-pox then prevalent, and which caused 116 of the deaths
reported. Aside from this epidemic the general health of the city
<pb>
was above the average from the 4th to the 11th of Septem-
ber, 1870. During the week ending on the 18th of September—
the city was then invested—the mortality had risen to 1,263; in
the week ending October 23rd the mortality had risen to 1,746.
The deaths reported during the week ending October 30th were
1,878; during the week ending November 20th, 2,064; during
the week ending December 18th, 2,728; during the week ending
January 1st, 1871, 3,280; during the week ending January
14th, 3,982; during the week ending January 28th, 4,376;
during the week ending February 4th, 4,671. Now the average
mortality for this last week, the week ending February 4th,
during the five years just referred to, was but 951. On the 4th
of February, the death-rate being at its maximum, the first train
of provisions entered Paris under the terms of the armistice.
After this time provisions came in abundantly and the death-rate
slowly but quite steadily declined. The deaths reported for the
week ending February 11th were 4,451; for the week ending
February 18th, 4,103; for the week ending February 25th, 3,941;
for the week ending March 4th, 3,500; for the week ending
March 11th, 2,993; for the week ending March 17th, 2,576.
From the fall of the Empire until the establishment of the
Commune—from the 4th of September until the 18th of March—
the total number of deaths within the city, not including those
who may have died in the army outside of the walls, was 77,231.
The average aggregate mortality of the twenty-eight corresponding
weeks during the period of five years, already referred to, was
24,928—a difference of 52,303.
As the population, civil and military, of Paris may be fairly
reckoned at 2,000,000 of souls, it appears that death carried
off about four per cent, of the whole population in a period of
twenty-eight weeks. The exact per cent. was 3-86; but the per-
centage of the death-rate in ordinary times is only 1-31. Or to
state the fact in another way, during the period mentioned, among
every 10,000 persons there were 386 deaths, while in ordinary
times during the corresponding weeks, among 10,000 persons
there are but 131 deaths.
For the great mortality existing during the siege there were
many causes. The most obvious cause was the absence of proper
<pb>
food. Milk, eggs, and butter had disappeared from the markets
after the first fortnight—all highly important elements of food,
as well for the sick, as for the very old and the very young.
Nor after this time were fish, chickens, or game of any kind to
be obtained in quantities sufficient to exert a sensible influence
upon the health of any portion of the population. Vegetables
had disappeared from the markets by the end of November, or
were sold at high prices in pieces—half a carrot, a bit of beet, a
leaf of cabbage, &c. The rationing of meat began on the 8th of
October, 100 grammes (a trifle over 3 oz.) being the daily allow-
ance fixed for each adult; and this ration was rapidly reduced to
33 grammes, the daily allowance for some weeks preceding the
capitulation.
Bread was not rationed until the middle of December; but its
quality, from various causes, had steadily depreciated from the
beginning of the siege. About the middle of December flour
and grain of all kinds were requisitioned, and bread was made
and issued by the municipality at the rate of 300 grammes daily
per head. The quantity of this ration was maintained until the
close of the siege, but its quality grew rapidly worse by mixing
with the flour, barley, oats, rye, buckwheat, rice, &c. These
grains, especially the rice, were very imperfectly ground, and
caused the bread made from them to be as disagreeable -to the
taste as it was unpleasant to the sight. The unusual qualities of
the bread gave rise to more frequent and bitter complaints than
did the complete withdrawal from the alimentation of the city of
such important articles of food as milk, butter, and vegetables,
or even the short rations upon which the whole population was
placed. And these complaints were not limited to the people;
they made their appearance even in the medical journals. Says
the " Union Meclicale" :—" The bread, the principal aliment of the
French people, has become impossible. Examined under a
microscope, or even with a lens, there may be found in that
compact, heavy, and blackish mass that is distributed to us every
morning a complete vegetable encyclopaedia; all the grains in
creation are there represented, not only by their farinaceous
principles, but by their husks and stalks . . . We cannot under-
stand what hygienic council was consulted previous to the decree
<pb>
of the Government which fixed the ration of bread at 300
grammes. We should be glad to believe that no hygienist had
given such advice, nor counselled the distribution for a month
to two millions of people of that shapeless and chaotic mass
ironically called bread."
Notwithstanding these facts, I am inclined to believe the
general population of Paris did not suffer to the extent usually
supposed from the want of food. Certain articles were always
abundant; wine, animal fats, vegetable oils, coffee—even bread,
such as it was, was never scarce—while the stocks of sweetmeats,
pickles, dried fruits, canned meats and vegetables, and quite a
variety of edible articles which the shops contained, were by no
means exhausted when the city capitulated. An important fact,
also to be observed, is that the disappearance of an alimentary
substance from the market did not indicate its non-existence.
Nearly everybody laid in a certain stock of provisions, and the
aggregate amount of food thus stored was enormous. It was
scarcely before the 1st of January that any persons in comfortable
circumstances, or who had been in the least degree thoughtful,
began to find their daily bills of fare seriously curtailed.1 Again,
the effect of being deprived of special nutritive elements would
only be manifested after the lapse of a certain time.
With regard to the poor, it was often said, and not without
reason, that they were better fed during the siege than in ordinary
times. Large numbers of this class were enrolled in the garde
nationale, and, by their withdrawal from the workshops, the
general demand for labour was to the same extent increased.
The municipality, however, from various motives, among which
1 When it became evident that Paris was an objective point in the German strategic
plan, the Government of the Empire set itself vigorously to work to organize a de-
fence; and during the last weekof August under the direction of It. Clement Duvcrnois,
then minister of agriculture and commerce, certain quantities of flour, wheat, <fec.,
were introduced into the city, and contracts were made for the delivery—at a short
delay—of siege supplies on a large scale. The Revolution of the 4th of September
put an end, not only to the Imperial Government, but to all systematic effort to pro-
vision the city. If Paris was able to feed its population for five months or more,
official provision is entitled to very little credit for the fact; it is to be attributed
principally to the existence of t hose vast stocks of provisions which the commerce of
modern times has the habit of storing in or near great cities.
<pb>
were perhaps reasons of political expediency, watched over the
physical interests of this class with unusual care.
It is a noteworthy fact, that whatever diseases may have pre-
vailed, few cases of scurvy were reported, either in the army or
among the civil population. Again, the excessive mortality fell
principally upon three distinct classes—the very young, the very
old, and the army; and those who suffered most, were those
unused to camp life—soldiers in the garde nationale and the
garde mobile.
These facts are revealed in the following tabular statement.

We see from this table that while the deaths under five were
nearly three times greater than usual, those between fifteen and
twenty-five were over six times as great as usual. Now it was
the class of persons between these ages who were most strongly re-
presented in the army of the defence, and who were moreover least
able to resist the hardships and exposures of a life to which they had
been wholly unaccustomed. But the whole case is not presented
in this table. A classification of the deaths according to sex shows
that, during the six months from September 1st to February
28th, 1870-71, the deaths of males between the ages of fifteen and
twenty-five were nearly ten times greater than usual (9-85); while
the deaths among females between these ages were less than three

Siege," par M. Henri Sueur. Paris, 1872.
<pb>
times greater than usual (2-85),—less, in fact, than the average
increment in the mortality among the whole population. But
among the general population between the ages of forty and
sixty the death-rate was 2-38 times greater than usual, and
among women between those ages it was 2-27 times greater than
usual. The remarkable exemption of women from disease and
death during the siege may be shown by another statement.
Excluding children under fifteen, the total number of males who
died during the month of September was 1,328 ; but in January
the number reported was 6,551. On the other hand, the number
of females over fifteen years of age who died in September was
1,116, while the number reported in January was only 2,582.
That is to say, during the siege, in the population, excluding
children, the mortality had increased among the males five times,
while it had scarcely more than doubled among the females.
But it should be observed that the mortality was not wholly
owing to causes directly connected with the siege. An epidemic
of small-pox, which broke out in 1869, raged for eighteen months
"with a violence,'" says M. Bouchardat, "unknown since the
generalization of vaccination." Having partially died out in
August, 1870, with the introduction into Paris of 100,000
mobiles from the country, and the crowding in of nearly 200,000
refugees, driven in from the suburbs by the investing armies of
the enemy, fresh material was furnished, and the epidemic broke
out again with new fury. From week to week the death-rate
increased until the 1st of January, when, for the week ending on
that day, 454 deaths were reported from small-pox alone.
During the siege proper, from the 18th of September to the
28th of January, 48,752 persons died, and of these 6,663, or
nearly fourteen per cent. (13-7), died of small-pox.
However imf>ortant this fact may be from a general point of
view, it has a special importance to which I wish to call your
attention. The presence of this disease in Paris was accidental,
and not necessarily connected with the siege. It showed no
special preference for either sex, and consequently was relatively a
large element in the comparatively small mortality among females.
Had there been no small-pox in Paris, the death-rate among
females would have been scarcely more than double that usually
<pb>
existing. This fact is very significant, as it shows that aside
from mere want of food, other causes must have been active in
producing the heavy mortality rates which obtained among the
population. Want of food contributed to these heavy rates, by
depriving a certain class of delicate persons of the food to which
they had been accustomed, and by forcing them to use that
instead which was not easily assimilated. A cachectic and
adynamic condition followed which predisposed to disease, and
when disease came, favoured a fatal termination. Indeed, the
want of proper food was felt vastly more in the hospitals and
among the sick than among the population at large; and if the
mortality was higher than usual, it was rather because the death-
rates among the sick were extraordinarily high, than because the
sickness-rates themselves were excessive. I do not wish to be
understood to say that the sickness-rates were not excessive, but
simply that the death-rates were still more so—that the health of
Paris during the siege, measured by the amount of absolute
sickness existing, did not differ so much from its usual health
as the mortality rates seem to indicate.
It is perhaps not surprising, for reasons already given, that
the disappearance of certain articles of food from the markets
and the successive reductions of the municipal ration should
have had no visible immediate influence upon the mortality.
Thus, after the first rationing of meat in October, and the requi-
sition of vegetables early in November, the death-rate did not
bound up at once. In fact, while on the eighth week of the
siege 1,878 deaths were reported, on the week following there
were but 1,762, an actual reduction of 116. Again, while on
the eighth week—the week ending on the 30th of October—
there were 1,878 deaths ; on the twelfth week, the week ending
on the 27th of November, the mortality had only risen to 1,927,
an increase of forty-nine deaths during the month. One month
after, the weekly deaths had risen to 3,280, an increase of 1,353.
What was the cause of this great difference in the mortality rates
of the two months? The answer is very easy to give. The im-
mediate cause of the great rise in the mortality during the
month of December was the cold weather which then prevailed.
The relation of existing atmospheric temperatures to the rise
<pb>
and fall of the death-rate is one of the most remarkable of the
phenomena which appeared during the course of the siege.
Whenever the temperature fell the mortality rates immediately
increased ; whenever the temperatures rose the mortality rates
immediately diminished. Thus, at the end of the eighth week
the thermometer rose, and the ninth week showed a falling off in
the mortality. On the tenth and eleventh weeks the temperature
fell, and the mortality rates increased. Again, on the twelfth
week the temperature rose, and was maintained at an average of
nearly five degrees centigrade above the average of the week
preceding, and the mortality of the twelfth week was only 1,927,
while the deaths reported the preceding week had been 2,064.
But however remarkable these relations, they were less so than
those which immediately followed. Up to the middle of the
thirteenth week—the 2nd of December—the mean daily tempe-
rature had not been below the freezing point; on that day it fell
below the freezing point, and there remained for a fortnight, and
the deaths reported on the thirteenth week numbered 2,023, on
the fourteenth week 2,455, and on the fifteenth week 2,728. In
twenty-one days the mortality had increased by eight hundred
deaths per week, while in the month preceding, after twenty-eight
days, the increased weekly mortality was only forty-nine.
But it may be said the want of food did not immediately show
its influence on the public health, and that with the supplies of
food known to exist in Paris, it could hardly have been before
December that famine could have begun to appear as a powerful
factor among the causes of mortality. Indeed, it might be added
that the disappearance of vegetables a month before, and the
rationing of meat six weeks before, and the appearance in the
public markets of such questionable meats as those of the dog
and cat, would fully account for the rapid rise in the death-rate
which marked the first weeks of December.
This reasoning is theoretically excellent. A single fact, how-
ever, shows that the causes just mentioned were not sufficient to
account for the increase in the death-rate referred to. On the
13th of December the temperature rose, and during the seven
days which followed the average temperature was never below
6 deg. centigrade. But in the meantime provisions were growing
<pb>
more and more scarce each day, and it was during this week
that the ration of horse meat was reduced to thirty grammes, and
the whole population was put on a bread ration of 300 grammes.
The rationing of bread, considered as a sort of official declaration
of the desperate state of affairs, caused great consternation, and pro-
foundly affected the morale of the city. Famine had never before
pinched so tightly. The week preceding the deaths had num-
bered 2,728—the heaviest weekly mortality yet reported. An
immense augmentation might have been expected in the mortuary
returns for the week. But such was not the case: the deaths
reported for the week ending December 25th were 2,728, exactly
the number reported the previous week. A mortality increasing at
the rate of three or four hundred deaths per week had been sud-
denly arrested—by what? But a single answer can be given.
All the general conditions capable of appreciation which in-
fluenced the health of the city had changed only for the worse,
except one. The weather had moderated, a mild and pleasant
week had succeeded a period of constant frost. This was the
only respect in which the situation had been altered, and the
conclusion was irresistible that its relation to the arrested mor-
tality was that of a cause. Had there been any doubt in the
matter it could not have existed long. On the 21st of December
the weather became cold again; the temperature fell below zero,
and it remained below the freezing point at a mean average of
6 deg. centigrade for sixteen days. Immediately with the fall
of the temperature the mortality increased, rising from 2,728 to
3,280 for the week ending January 1st, and it continued to
steadily increase as long as the cold weather continued, until the
deaths reached the number of 4,465 for the week ending January
21st. But the next week shows a falling off in the number of
deaths—but 4,376 were reported; and on looking at the tempe-
rature of the period we find an upward curve corresponding with
the reduced mortality. On the 27th of January the temperature
fell again below the freezing point, and there remaining several
days, the mortality rapidly increased, and culminated, in the
week ending February 4th, in 4,671 deaths, the largest number
reported for any week during the siege. On the 4th of February
the first train of provisions reached Paris from without; but it is
<pb>
a remarkable fact that the death-rate had again begun to decline
two or three days before the arrival of this train, and, as always,
in correspondence with a rise of the temperature. But the tem-
perature continuing to rise for nearly ten days, and provisions
beginning to come in abundantly, the mortality continued to
decline.
From the 28th of January until the 18th of March the tem-
perature fell below the freezing point but once, on the 11th of
February and curiously enough its effect was almost immedi-
ately shown by a partial arrest of the decline of the mortality;
the average reduction per week in the deaths from the 4th of
February to the 18th of March having been 349, while for the
week following the 11th of February it was but 255.
In tracing the influence of cold upon the population of Paris,
it should be observed that the winter of 1870-71 was an unusu-
ally severe one. For twelve days on one occasion, for sixteen
days on another, and for seven days on another, the temperature
scarcely rose once above the freezing point, ranging from this point
down to — 11° centigrade (12° Fah.). In ordinary times the in-
fluence of such a protracted period of cold, as that which marked
the end of 1870 and the beginning of the year 1871, would have
been revealed in the weekly bills of mortality. But the population
of Paris suffered unusually from the cold, not more on account of
its actual severity than from the absence of fuel. The city was
invested before the winter supplies of fuel had been brought in.
A large portion, even of the provisions which had been made, lay
en depot outside of the French lines. The small stocks of coal
and coke were rapidly exhausted, and wood was requisitioned on
the 1st of November. The same month the municipality began
to issue coal-dust and green wood obtained by cutting down the
shade trees in the parks and avenues. During the severest
weather of the winter these two last-mentioned kinds of fuel
were alone to be obtained by the mass of the population, and for
several weeks before the capitulation, in quantities so small and
under conditions such as to be almost worthless, except perhaps
for cooking. One of the most painful and, once seen, never to
be forgotten spectacles of the siege of Paris, was the distribution
of the fuel ration to long lines of shivering men and women, who
<pb>
stood for hours in the cold, bleak streets waiting each their turn
to obtain perhaps two or three little pieces of green wood, almost
as incombustible as the ice beneath their feet. During the sharp
wintry days of January the fuel famine was more keenly felt than
the want of food, and every day of sunlight and warmth was as
.welcome to the distressed people as would have been the arrival
of a train of fresh provisions. A large part of the population
during some of the severest weather of the winter had no means
whatever of warming their rooms by artificial heat. The poor
kept warm by huddling together in their already over-crowded
quarters; and the rich even, rather by shutting out the cold and
the fresh air than by the heat of fires.
The hospitals, if generally better supplied with fuel, were never-
theless compelled to be rigidly economical in its use, an economy
followed by a proportionally defective ventilation, with its usual
consequences.
To appreciate the full extent to which cold influenced the
death-rate, the remarkable correspondence between the mortality
rates and the existing atmospheric temperature must be associ-
ated with the fact already stated, that the deaths among males
between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five, that is to say,
among those enrolled in the Garde Nationale and consequently
most exposed to the influences of cold, were nearly ten times
greater than usual, while among females at a corresponding
period of life, among those least exposed to these influences,
the deaths were only a little over twice as great as usual.
The effects of cold and exposure, as a cause of disease and
death, were certainly never more remarkably exhibited. Aside
from the epidemic of small-pox, cold was most unquestion-
ably the direct cause of by far the largest part of the mortality
during the siege. But it may be said that cold weather does
not commonly appear to be so prejudicial to the public health.
Certainly not; there was a cause, a general condition which
revealed or let loose its destructive influences. That cause was
undoubtedly the want of proper food, and the condition was
what the French have well termed la misere physiologique—the
physiological poverty—the defective nutrition, of the whole popu-
lation. Badly nourished, deprived of milk, butter, and easily
<pb>
assimilated animal fats—compelled to resort to a diet deficient
in hydrocarbons, or difficult of digestion, the power of resisting
the evil effects of cold was greatly reduced by the diminished
evolution of animal heat; the fires of life burned dimly, and the
blood and tissues had been chilled before even the winter frosts
came. It was in this way that the want of proper food produced
its worst effects during the siege, not directly by causing starva-
tion or any very near approach to it, but indirectly by limiting
the evolution of animal heat, and thus depriving men of the
power of resisting the impressions produced by prolonged ex-
posures to the cold.
Every one is familiar with the increased demand and craving
for food during the winter, as well as in cold climates; the precise
consequences of not responding to this demand, to this natural
craving, were never known in all their fearful reality until the
publication in the Records of the Department of the Seine of the
essential facts connected with the terrible physiological experiment
to which Paris was subjected during the siege of 1870-71.'
The diseases which principally prevailed and proved most
deadly were, as might have been expected from the causes at
work, diseases of the respiratory organs. Until, however, the
fourteenth week—the 11th of December—the proportional mor-
tality from these diseases was less than usual, but 215 deaths
1 As illustrating the condition to which the troops were brought by the continued
action of insufficient food, fatigue, exposure, and cold, Dr. Gordon mentions an in-
teresting incident:—" From the month of September, when the siege began, till the
date of the last great battle, it may be said that the great body of the troops lived in
the bivouac, exposed to all weathers, with little or no comfort, and without continuous
rest. The battle of Montretout and Bougival produced a large number of wounded,
of whom sixty-four were sent to the American ambulance. In the course of the
evening I visited the portion of that establishment where they were accommodated.
On either side of a long tent some were arranged, comfortably put to bed, and there
they lay, covered with blood, it is true, but all sound asleep; not a groan was heard,
although the wounds of all were dangerous, and of several mortal. Some had limbs
shattered by shot or shell; many had severe flesh wounds; one young man had
been struck by a Bavarian bullet in the forehead, one half of the missile still project-
ing; but so great had been the physical wear and tear of all for months before, that
their wounds, severe as they were, were yet insufficient to banish sleep when the
comforts of a bed and restoratives gave place to the miseries of the previous four
months." ("Lessons on Hygiene and Surgery," p. 227.)
<pb>
having been reported from bronchitis and pneumonia for that
week, in a total of 2,455 deaths. On the fifteenth week
the deaths from these, diseases suddenly rose with the cold
weather, which then set in, to 321, and they rapidly increased by
nearly two hundred a week, until on the twenty-second week
they were the cause of 1,092, or 23'6 per cent. of the 4,671
deaths reported. The mortality from these two diseases, espe-
cially that from bronchitis, followed in the closest manner the
changes in the temperature—rising with each fall of temperature,
and falling with each rise.
Typhoid fever was a prominent contributor to the general
mortality, although it fell far behind even small-pox. The
largest number of deaths from this cause, 375, was reported on
the twentieth week. The mortality rose from 39 deaths on the
first week, to 103 on the twelfth, to 221 on the sixteenth, and had
only descended to 229 on the twenty-eighth week. Relatively,
however, typhoid fever was the most fatal of all the diseases
directly occasioned by the siege, as will appear from the fact
that during the twenty-eight corresponding weeks of the year
1869-70 the weekly deaths from typhoid fever, never exceeding
thirty, ranged between that number and fifteen.
Typhoid fever did not apparently follow in its ascending and
descending course the variations in the temperature. This was
to have been expected from a disease having a specific character,
and which, from the period of its incubation, passes slowly and
regularly through its different stages. The heavy mortality of
February and March was produced by disease which was germi-
nated when the general mortality of Paris was greatest and its
sanitary condition worst.
Diarrhoea and dysentery follow next in order among the fatal
diseases. The largest number of deaths from these two diseases
—240—were reported on the twenty-sixth week. Nearly all
the general facts mentioned as peculiar to the history of typhoid
fever characterized also these diseases. They contributed rela-
tively to the general mortality much more than positively, the
deaths from them having only ranged from nine to twenty-five
during the twenty-eight corresponding weeks of 1869-70. They
did not appear to be greatly influenced by the prevailing tem-
L L
<pb>
perature, and they did not contribute their maximum quota to
the mortality until some weeks after the general mortality had
begun to decline.
From the special facts here presented, a general idea may be
formed as well of the sanitary condition of the city at different
periods of the siege as of the causes which were influencing it.
I regret, however, my not being in possession of a sufficient
number of data to attempt to show the influence of these causes
upon the wounded, whether by increasing the actual death-rate,
or by developing typical forms of hospitalism among this class
of patients.1 One fact is certain, the army was more exposed
than any other part of the population to all the depressing causes
special to the siege. It was put upon shorter rations; it was
subjected to greater fatigues; it was crowded into closer and
more ill-ventilated quarters, and was more exposed to night air,
rain and frost.
A large part of the mortality from disease during the siege
was contributed by the army, and resulted from the general
causes just referred to. The soldier, suffering from their effects
when wounded, would under any circumstances have had his
chances of recovery diminished thereby; but unable to escape
from their continued action—an action which day by day became
more and more severe—it is by no means surprising if the mor-
tality among the wounded in all the ambulances of Paris was
1 Only a small number of the volunteer ambulances have as yet made reports pos-
sessing any statistical value. The report of the War Department, should it ever
appear, -will inevitably be incomplete and most unsatisfactory, while the mortuary
returns of the city of Paris throw little if any light on the subject. These returns
in principle include all the deaths, from whatever cause, occurring within the limits
of the city. As nearly all the ambulances, together with the civil hospitals and the
great military hospitals—Le Val de Grace and Le Gros Caillou—were within the
limits of the city, were these returns complete we should be in possession of much
of the data bearing upon the mortality of the army during the siege. But on ex-
amining the municipal monthly bulletins, I find that in the month of September
37 deaths were attributed to wounds received in battle (blessures militaires); in
October 333 deaths are attributed to the same cause; in November no deatM were
reported from this cause; while in December the number had risen to 1,058. In
short, the military mortuary statistics of the siege are in about as hopeless a con-
dition as possible, and beyond certain gross aggregates which may approximate the
truth, our knowledge is never likely to be much extended.
<pb>
unprecedentedly heavy, and recoveries among the severely
wounded proportionally rare.
It is fortunate that we are seldom called upon to treat either
the sick or wounded under circumstances so painful. We were
forced to see large numbers of persons die after wounds not
usually considered dangerous; and the deaths occurred frequently
even after the wounds had nearly or quite healed.
If our mortality rate was unusually high, the most evident and
efficient cause—the general sanitary state of Paris—must be taken
into consideration when establishing comparisons between our
results and those obtained under other general circumstances.
Indeed, the only just comparisons are such as may be made
between our results and those obtained in other ambulances and
hospitals opened in Paris during the same period, and receiving
the same class of patients.
I will close this section of my subject by appending two tables
copied from the essay of M. Sueur, which show the relations
between the weekly mortality and the mean temperature.

1 I am sorry that I am unable to here present a number of facts which should
enter into a mortality table—such as the cause of death, and the sex of the dece-
dents. But the city monthly record of vital statistics has—at the time of my writing—
only been published down to the 1st of January, 1871, and therefore no official tables
covering the whole period of the siege have as yet appeared. While indebted to the
gentlemen in charge of the Bureau of Statistics at the Prefecture of tho Seine for much
valuable information, the only table I can present is unofficial and incomplete,
although the facts it contains were derived from official sources, and are entirely
trustworthy.

Location: Character of the Grounds.—Before speaking of
our tents and tent-barracks it may be well to briefly notice the
general situation of the ambulance, and the character of the grounds
upon which it was placed. In some respects the situation was a
good one, in other respects it was a bad one. On the north side
of the Avenue de 1'ImpeVatrice, about half way between the Arc
de Triomphe and the Bois de Boulogne, was an open lot, contain-
ing nearly an acre and a-half of ground; it was partially shut in
by houses, but fronted directly upon the wide beautiful avenue
so well known to all who may ever have been in Paris. Although
within the walls of the city, this quarter of Paris is quite subur-
ban, and is covered principally with villas, small parks and gar-
dens. The air was consequently to a considerable degree free
from the impurities common to it, where the population is dense.
This part of Paris lies, however, in the valley of the Seine, and
has always seemed to me to be more subject to inundations of
fog from the river than even the. central portions of the city
through which the river passes. From the Arc de Triomphe
the ground slopes gently to the fortifications, from which it
spreads out in a low alluvial plain quite to the Seine. As nearly
the whole region is unpaved, the special influences upon health
of such a formation are much more likely to be exhibited than
in the more strictly metropolitan portion of the Paris basin.
I certainly do not wish to say that this most delightful part of
Paris is unhealthy as compared with other portions of the city,
since special causes here contribute to a condition of general
salubrity which perhaps it would be difficult to find elsewhere
in Paris; I only wish to say, that I should not, from theoretical
<pb>
considerations, select such a location as one possessing the best
conditions for the installation of a permanent camp, and a
fortiori, for the establishment of a permanent field hospital. Un-
fortunately, theoretical considerations had but very little if any
weight in the determination of our choice. Early in September
it became absolutely necessary to pitch our tents somewhere, and
get ready for the conflict which was daily becoming more im-
minent. The great question was not so much where could we
find the best place for the tents within the walls of Paris, as of
whom could we obtain the privilege of using a plot of ground
sufficiently large for our purpose. A lot upon the Avenue de
l'lmperatrice was generously offered to us, and we immediately
accepted the offer. The plot was by no means prepossessing; it
was flat, covered with a rank vegetation, and had the appearance
of a rich but neglected garden; and I may add that previously to
our occupation it had been used for a dog show—several hundred
dogs having been encamped there, during a considerable part of
the summer of 1870.
The soil was to a certain extent artificial, the plot having been
filled in, to a height of ten feet or more, to bring it to a level
with the avenue. Unfortunately, this soil contained so large a
percentage of clay as to be quite impenetrable to water; inas-
much as the surface, moreover, was almost perfectly level, it be-
came exceedingly difficult to properly drain it; indeed, during
rainy weather this most important service was only indifferently
accomplished by conducting the drains around the tents to pits
sunk in the ground at various places.
The ground was perfectly dry all winter long at a distance of
two feet below its surface. The only chance of escape for the
water which fell upon it was by evaporation, a process almost in-
finitely slow under the sombre sky of a Paris winter. The con-
sequence was, that we were always in the midst of moisture, and
what was apparently far worse, of mud. In fact, this was the
greatest inconvenience, resulting directly upon the nature of the
soil and the character of the location, to which we were sub-
jected, the whole surface of the ground at every rainfall having
been converted into a veritable slough. Plank-walks enabled
us for a time to pass dry-shod from tent to tent; but as the season
<pb>
became wetter, during the thaws of December and January, it
was almost impossible for either men or carriages to cross certain
portions of the ground. The loads of gravel which we threw
upon certain places disappeared almost immediately, and it was
only after the worst spots had been paved with large stones, and
hundreds of loads of gravel, sand, and tan had been distributed
over its surface, and I may also say after the weather itself be-
came dryer, that the condition of the ground could have been
pronounced satisfactory. Not only was the mud a source of in-
convenience, but it made it frequently quite impossible for us to
preserve that tidiness, both without and within our tents, which
was desirable, not more as an evidence of our regard for well-
known sanitary requirements than as an evidence of the orderly
and systematic execution of our ponce service.
To what extent the condition of the ground, to which I here
refer, may have acted upon the health of those treated at the
ambulance, I am unable to say; it may, however, have been the
more or less direct cause of several of the cases of bronchitis,
pleurisy, and pneumonia—some of them fatal—which occurred
when the subjects had so far convalesced from their wounds as
to be able to leave the tents, and even to walk about the enclosure.
Still, whatever may have been the unfortunate degree of humi-
dity existing in the surface soil without the tents, the earth was
always kept dry within them, by means which I shall elsewhere
explain.
The geometrical form of our grounds, if a much less serious
cause of inconvenience, nevertheless, greatly interfered with any
attempt to establish the tents and barracks in accordance with
a plan which should give symmetry to the whole installation.
Indeed, since the removal of the constructions, having had occa-
sion to re-examine the location, it has been a constant subject
of surprise to me, that we ever succeeded in placing our tents
and barracks upon it, in a way which shocked the harmonies of
proportion and position so little.
While the tents and barracks were arranged so far as possible
—consistently with having the freest circulation of air between
them all—with reference to convenience and symmetry, and
various efforts were made to keep the earth dry and firm, some-
<pb>
thing also was done for mere appearance' sake. Plots here and
there were railed in and planted with flowers and shrubbery.
In the month of September a large number of trees were cut
down in the Bois de Boulogne to unmask the approaches to the
city. Among these were many ornamental evergreens—pines
and firs; a fine selection from these was made, and the trees
were soon replanted around our tents and walks. This shrubbery
retained its dark green colour during the entire winter, and
added much to the picturesqueness of the grounds; although
we never attached to its presence the sanitary importance
entertained by some of our visitors, who, impressed by whatever
was novel or unique in the organization of the ambulance, seem
to have been fully persuaded that "those singular Americans"
had discovered in the balsamic properties of the fir-tree a specific
against the invasions of hospitalism.
The Tents: How Arranged.—I have elsewhere had occasion
to speak in a general way of the manner in which our tents and
tent-barracks were distributed over the ground, as also how our
hospital tents were arranged. I have said that five or six tents
were joined together, end to end, in such a way as to form a long
rectangular pavilion. I have described also how an American
wall-tent is pitched. I may however, in this place, direct your
attention to several points, each of some importance.
The tent pavilions (see Ground Plan, Plate 1) were placed
parallelly to each other, their ends facing northerly and southerly,
the prevailing winds thus sweeping freely between them. Just
behind them, and possibly a little nearer than desirable, stood
the tent for. wounded officers. The tent-barracks for the
wounded, Nos. 7 and 10, were placed on each side of the area
behind the pavilions. These wards were as far from each other
and the pavilions as possible. Barrack No. 8—in which were
the kitchen, salle a manger, pharmacy, &c.—was built nearly at
right angles with the barracks Nos. 7 and 10. It was separated
from No. 7 by a free passage-way, and from No. 10 by a covered
passage-way. Barracks Nos. 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19, occupied the
eastern side of the plot. All the constructions were thus de-
tached as well as separated from each other, so far as convenience
and the extent and conformation of the ground permitted.
<pb>
Our organization having assumed from the first a certain cha-
racter of permanence, the ground within each one of the tents,
as well as barracks, was covered with a floor formed of strips of
board laid side by side, and nailed to narrow (two and a-half
inch or three inch) string pieces, which rested on the ground.
While this floor answered its purpose very well, for aught
I know, I can hardly recommend it when tents are to be kept
long standing. The cracks between the boards permit dirt of all
kinds to sift through and accumulate on the ground beneath,
where it may become in time a source of pollution. To guard
against such an occurrence, our floors were once entirely taken
up. After the earth beneath had been to a certain extent
removed, and the tents closed and thoroughly fumigated with
chlorine, the soil was sprinkled with proto-sulphate of iron and
the floors relaid. These precautions were doubtless wise, but
the necessity for them might have been in a measure avoided had
the flooring been covered by some impermeable stuff—oilcloth,
for example—which would have had the additional advantage of
being susceptible of frequent cleansings.
The trenches which were dug on the sides of each pavilion
were a foot broad and about eight inches deep, the earth being
thrown towards the tents and banked up against a narrow strip
of board, that preserved the canvas from immediate contact
with the soil.
The entrance to each tent in which the wounded were treated
was guarded by a vestibule, or tambour, which was entered by a
door closed by a pulley and weight. The principal object of the
vestibule was to prevent the too direct entrance of cold air; it
was however very useful in several respects; it added to the
capacity of the tent, and served as a convenient closet for many
utensils in daily use. In the field, a substitute for it, so far as it
served to keep out currents of cold air, may be obtained by sus-
pending one or two blankets outside or inside of the tent door.
Tent-Barracks.—When our ambulance was first established,
we did not propose to make use of any shelter for the wounded
except that afforded by tents. For reasons which I have else-
where stated, it seemed desirable at a later period to increase
the number of beds. Suitable tents could not be obtained in
<pb>
Paris for this purpose, and our only alternative was either to
place the additional beds in some one or more neighbouring
houses, or erect upon our own grounds constructions which
might properly be used for the shelter of our patients. The
benefits to be derived from the use of tents in the hospitalization
of the sick seemed to us to be so considerable, as to warrant the
attempt to secure some of them by the erection of temporary
constructions possessing several of the desirable qualities spe-
cial to tents. In my general description of the ambulance I
have stated how these constructions—tent-barracks—were made;
that they were made of simple frameworks, boarded up on
the sides and at the ends, and roofed with canvas. They were
built, however, much less for the purpose of showing a system of
hospital construction than with the intention of obtaining, what
seemed to be an immediate necessity, an airy shelter for the sick.
The buildings were consequently rude, while they were defective
perhaps in regard to certain details, which would have been made
the subject of a more careful consideration had not everything
been put up in a hurry.
Our tent-barracks were certainly preferable to houses for the
treatment of the sick; they were new buildings, which had
never been occupied, and the fresh air supply was tolerably well
secured; but I have always considered them as offering less
favourable sanitary conditions than tents. In the first place,
they were not as impermeable to water. Three thicknesses of
canvas (French) had to be put upon the roofs before they
fairly kept the water out, and yet during the whole winter
they were constantly leaking at certain points. This leakage
was doubtless partly attributable to the quality of the canvas,
but it was also partly attributable to the fact that the canvas
rested upon a framework of rafters. Had the best Ameri-
can duck been used for a roofing, it would unquestionably
have occasionally leaked had it been so supported. The use
of two or more thicknesses of canvas for the purpose of securing
impermeability to wet, resulted in rendering the roof to nearly
the same degree impermeable to air; if the roof is really imper-
meable to air, such a construction cannot properly be called a
tent-barrack, it is simply a barrack; whether a roof is covered
<pb>
with impermeable zinc or impermeable linen is a matter of no
moment so far as ventilation is concerned.
It was more difficult to maintain a proper temperature in our
tent-barracks than in our tents. It is true they were heated
with stoves; but so was tent No. 21. The air entered them at
various irregular openings, and escaped to a considerable extent in
the same manner. The principal ward-barrack was ventilated by
a shaft; but the two ward-barracks were rarely free from the odour
peculiar to hospitals. It was thought necessary once or twice to
whitewash the walls and rafters within, if partly to improve the
light, partly also for sanitary reasons. The only advantages our
barracks possessed that our tents did not I have elsewhere
mentioned as special to barracks in general. They were roomier
than tents, had windows and doors which could be locked and
barred, and afforded a sense of security to persons, and afforded a
real security for things, which the tents did not. They conse-
quently answered much better than tents for the various offices
connected with the ambulance.
Lighting.—The tents were lighted at night by oil lamps
provided with chimneys and shades. A lamp was fixed in each
tent to one of the upright standards; candles were used for
movable lights.1 In the tent-barracks and offices similar lamps
and candles were used. The grounds were also well lighted by
oil lamps furnished with strong reflectors. The charge of the
lamps gave constant employment to one man. Not one of the
least remarkable sights connected with the ambulance was its
appearance at night when lighted up; the tents and pavilions,
and tent-barracks even, looking rather like immense Chinese
lanterns than the habitations of men. The moving lights of the
attendants, the coloured signals, the grotesque shadows which
appeared and disappeared as suddenly—all these strange effects
1 It has been remarked that candles are not as good as lamps for lighting a ward,
"because they often emit unpleasant odours, especially when the wicks are long or
they are snuffed." Lamps are certainly much better than candles for permanent
lights, but good candles are by no means as likely to smoke and emit unpleasant
odours as equally good lamps. All lamps require constant regulating. For field
service, candles are greatly to be preferred to lamps—because it is more easy to
transport them, and less difficult to take care of them.
<pb>
of light often gave a singular and almost weird-like animation to
our little encampment after nightfall. By day the barracks were
fairly lighted by windows shaded with muslin curtains. The tents
only received such light as was diffused through the canvas, and
yet I doubt if, during the day even, the tents were less well lighted
than the barracks. The absence of windows has been considered
an objection to the use of tents; not so much, however, because
windows let in light, as because they afford to patients occasional
opportunities of relieving the tedium of their confinement by
looking out of doors. It is a fact, however, not unworthy of
remark, that nearly all our patients manifested a decided pre-
ference for the tents, and few, if any, were transferred from them
to a barrack who did not express an anxious desire to get back
to their old quarters. The barracks lacked something of the
cheerfulness which seemed to belong always to the tents, and
which was probably largely owing to the uniform diffusion and
the softness of the light within them.
Furniture.—I have elsewhere referred to the furniture of
the tents; and, although briefly, with perhaps sufficient detail.
Beside each bed was a chair or a small table. A table also stood
near the water-cock, while at the end of the pavilion was a buffet
in which were kept the bandages, medicines, feeding cups, and
various articles which the nurses might have occasion to use.
The wooden furniture in the wards was all of white unpainted
wood of the simplest and plainest kind.
The iron bedsteads which we made use of have been occasionally
criticised. As the patient is lifted from the floor scarcely more
than fifteen inches, even when lying on the mattress, they have
been considered too low, especially as the position they force the
attendant or surgeon to assume often becomes painful.
But it must be remembered that these bedsteads were pro-
posed and constructed, not as model bedsteads for general hospi-
tals, but as bedsteads for campaigning and for use in field-tents.
It was very desirable that they should be as light as possible
consistently with strength, and also that they should be low, in
order to gain head room.1
1 An objection made by the Germans to the establishment of a hospital at Sedan
<pb>
It would have been difficult to have used a much higher bed-
stead in our tents. To have increased the height of the bed would
have involved increasing the height of the tent walls; and the
objection to adding to the height of these walls in portable field-
tents has already been indicated. Moreover, if a low bed is some-
times inconvenient for the attendant, it is always very con-
venient for the sick man, and his interest should be first con-
sidered. Miss Nightingale has expressed the opinion that the
bed for the sick should never, "under any pretext," be higher
than a common sofa. Otherwise the sick man is unable to help
himself in many respects, and is additionally fatigued every time
it becomes necessary for him to get up or lie down. And it is
very singular, she remarks, that persons who only get in and out
of bed once a day forget that these efforts are frequently made
by the sick, and are often followed by much fatigue. These
considerations are of great importance, and may well lead us to
the conclusion that our beds were not too low, notwithstanding
the criticism referred to, and which I may add—although repeated
to me many times by French surgeons—I never once heard
from the lips of a French patient. Indeed, I believe that the
height to be given to a hospital bed should rarely exceed eighteen
inches.
If the American field hospital iron bedstead has any real fault
it is its want of strength—a want of strength shown, however,
rather by the breakage from rough handling in transportation
than from breakage in actual use. Not one of the hundred and
twenty-five iron bedsteads used at the ambulance by patients
and nurses was broken or seriously injured, during the six
months' service to which they were all subjected.
System Employed fob Warming and Ventilating the
Tents.—One of the most serious questions that has arisen in
connection with winter encampments has related to the best
and most practical method of securing a comfortable temperature
for those who are placed under canvas.
The general practice in camps since the very earliest times has
under tents, oaptured from the French, was that the bedsteads in use were too large
for the tents.
<pb>
been to rely upon the heat of fires burning in the open air and
outside of the tent.1 Sometimes they have been placed near the
tents—so near as to elevate the temperature of the air within
them; but generally they are too far away for this result,—the
object in view having always been rather to warm the soldier
than the quarters assigned him.
Indeed, it is very rarely that an attempt has been made to
warm the quarters of the common soldier. Even when huts
were used in former times, the soldier was forbidden under any
pretence the use of fire in his lodgings.2
It has been an occasional custom in camps—and one very preva-
lent during the eighteenth century—to construct special quarters
where the soldier might pass a portion of the day, returning to
his tent at night only to sleep. These were often subter-
ranean excavations, roofed with earth, in which fireplaces with
chimneys had been placed.3 But whatever may be said in favour
of such practices in general encampments, it is obvious that they
are inapplicable wherever the soldier—whether well or sick—is
forced to be a permanent occupant of his quarters. In such cases
—if the soldier is to be made comfortable—measures must be
taken with a view to the warming of the air within those quar-
ters. But the difficulty of maintaining a proper temperature
within tents during the colder months of the year has always
been recognized, and has been made even a serious objection to
their use, especially—as we have seen—for the hospitalization of
the sick. Incapable of storing up heat within their walls, as more
solid constructions do, it is impossible to make tents comfortable
except by providing in some way for a constant evolution of heat
within them. The great difficulty has always been to properly
regulate this heat supply. It is very easy to put in a tent a

<pb>
common sheet-iron camp stove provided with a few joints of pipe
(and this, by the way, is the usual practice), and with a little
wood build a fire sufficient to warm the air within the tent; but
generally after a few minutes the temperature will be found to be
most uncomfortably warm. If the ventilators are raised, or the
doors thrown open, the warm air rushes out, and the cold air
rushing in produces a violent perturbation in the temperature,
which will generally be found only to have become so comfort-
able as to permit the closing of the doors when the fire shall have
nearly died out in the stove. The consequence is, that the occu-
pant just at the moment he may suppose himself to have at
length succeeded in "regulating" the temperature, will probably
be warned by a rapidly-increasing sense of chilliness that his
fire has gone out, that more wood must be put into the stove,
and his experiment repeated over again. However often one
may have occasion to build a fire in this way in a tent, he
will rarely succeed in securing within it, except for a very
transient interval, a really comfortable and satisfactory tem-
perature.
If the fuel used be coal instead of wood, much better results
may be obtained, especially if the tent be large and the stove of
appropriate size. As coal burns slowly and very steadily, with suf-
ficient care the evolution of heat may be tolerably well regulated.
The chief practical difficulty, when coal is used, will consist in
making all parts of the tent at the same time quite comfortable;
if the fluctuations of temperature within the tent are not rapid,
the air in the immediate vicinity of the stove will often be found
disagreeably warm, while that in the remoter parts of the tent
may remain unpleasantly cold. But whatever advantages coal
may possess as a fuel for heating tents, the opportunities for
obtaining it and using it in camps are altogether too infrequent
to give them much practical importance.
In proposing any really useful system of warming tents, we
must rely for our heat upon the common fuel of the world—
wood.
Several methods of warming tents have at different times been
suggested or adopted which I may mention. Sir John Pringle
says:—" It will be found useful to burn spirits in the evening, in
<pb>
order to warm and correct the air in the tents." 1 It is probable,
however, that the old army physician makes the suggestion rather
for the purpose of correcting the air, than for the purpose of warm-
ing it. One of the most ancient as well as common methods is that
of placing within the tent, on the ground, upon a flat stone, or in
a brasier, a quantity of red-hot coals. If the danger from asphixia
is less under canvas than within the close walls of a room, the
unwholesomeness of the practice sufficiently condemns it. A
modification of this method is thus described by a writer quoted
by Capt. Galton.2 "When living in a tent in New Zealand,
during a severe winter we were perfectly numb with cold at
night, until we adopted the Maori plan, which is to dig a hole
about a foot square in the clear, to cover the bottom with a stone
or stones, and fill it at night with red-hot cinders from the camp-
fire, and lastly to close the tent excepting a small opening near
the top. The cinders are not nearly burned out by morning.
They diffused a pleasant warmth through the tent and rendered
us comfortable all night. There is no danger of suffocation un-
less the tent be closed up very tight indeed." This plan seems
to me scarcely less objectionable than the one previously stated,
and for the same reason, notwithstanding the assurance of the
writer that "there is no danger."
M. de Presle, as I have elsewhere remarked, speaks of
putting within the tent "a little fire in a chimney made of turf."
This is certainly a much better plan than either of the two I
have just referred to, and it may be really all that is needed
to make an ordinarily large tent perfectly comfortable, if
the fireplace is sufficiently large and the supply of wood not
deficient.
A much better plan is that of warming the tent by means
of a fairly well-constructed fireplace and chimney; this is a very
common method in modern camps, and was sometimes practised
in the last century.
In Grose's " Military Antiquities " there is a sketch of an English
marquee as pitched a hundred years ago. Outside of this tent
may be observed a large brick or clay chimney; the fireplace
1 Op. cit. p. 99.
* "Art of Travel," p. 167.
<pb>
evidently opens into the tent, and a very curious detail in the
sketch is the representation of an empty barrel upon the summit
of the chimney. The draught of the chimney seems to have been
found defective, and a means of improving it suggested which
during the War of the Rebellion I had always regarded not only
as an original, but as an indigenous invention.
The fireplace and chimney were very frequently used as a
means of warming tents in the Federal army during the War of the
Rebellion, particularly in permanent camps. I remember having
passed several weeks during one winter in a wall-tent, at the
back and outside of which a fireplace had been built of stones
and mud, surmounted by a chimney some 12 ft. high, made of
small sticks, laid crosswise, and well plastered on the inside with
mud. The fireplace opened directly into the tent, the canvas
having been raised and properly readjusted at its top and around
its sides. The cold was quite severe, but as we had a good
draught and plenty of wood, our fire was generally a bright
one. So .far from having suffered in any way from the incle-
mency of the season, I shall always remember those days as among
the pleasantest I have ever spent in camp, if partly by reason of
personal associations, not a little from a sort of local attachment
to the cheerful chimney corner, which I knew however stormy
it might be without, was always in reserve, warmly waiting for
my coming at the close of the day.
A fireplace, however, never can be employed without a great
waste of heat. Its use in camp presupposes therefore an abun-
dance of fuel, as also that it shall only be erected for the warm- ✓
ing of tents of moderate dimensions. The consequence is, that
whatever its excellences in certain cases, they are altogether too
dependent upon special circumstances to permit their general
utilization.
If one can employ with advantage for the warming of tents
neither stoves nor open fireplaces, it would almost seem as if any
attempt to secure for them a comfortable interior temperature
would lead to equally unsatisfactory results. The problem to
solve is certainly a difficult one. A mass of air is to be main-
tained at a certain temperature, while the walls investing it have
little power~to store up and return back by radiation the heat
M M
<pb>
subtracted from it. All heat, once having left the mass of air in
question, is lost for ever; and not only is this true, but the in-
vesting walls interpose but a slender barrier to the heat within,
which passes rapidly through them by conduction, or is carried
out in the rarefied air which oozes through a thousand pores and
fissures in the network of the tissue. The best idea of the
rapidity with which heat escapes from a tent, can be obtained by
going on a cold day in the winter into a tent provided with a
sheet-iron stove: put in the stove two or three newspapers; in a
few moments the atmosphere will have become quite uncomfort-
ably hot, and then after a few moments the temperature will
have almost as rapidly descended to the degree indicated by the
thermometer before building the fire; and the experiment may be
repeated again and again, with the same result—that is to say,
without any apparent permanent elevation of the temperature,
except that produced by the presence of the persons who may
have been in the tent.
To warm a tent successfully some method must be adopted
which may enable us to store up a portion of the heat generated
in excess of that immediately necessary to make the tent com-
fortable, and to store it up in such a way as that it shall graduaDy
and uniformly escape into the air within the tent. When a fire-
place is used it warms the air not only by throwing the heat
directly into the tent, but also by being itself a reservoir of heat
for some time after the fire may have been extinguished. A tank
or two of hot water, such as is used in railway carriages, will in
this way often warm a common tent very perfectly; so even will
a box of hot sand. But fortunately we have another and much
more practical means of providing tents with such a stock of
heat. If the air within a tent is enclosed on nearly every side
by walls incapable of retaining heat, on one side it rests in con-
tact with a deep solid wall—the earth. It only remains to con-
trive some ready method by which the ground shall always take
up and hold in reserve a large store of the heat generated for the
warming of the tent, and our problem will have been solved.
The question then is, how can we at the same time warm the
air in the tent and the ground under it? There are several
ways of doing this. One of these ways is to dig a sort of cellar
<pb>
under the tent two or three feet in depth, and to then place in
it a common stove. The cellar adds much to the capacity of the
tent, and its walls, warmed by the stove, serve as a reservoir of
heat, which contributes in the way indicated to the steadiness of
the temperature within. It was quite a common practice for the
officers of the English army to warm their tents in this way
while encamped before Sebastopol. A section of a tent so
arranged is shown in Fig. 44. It is difficult, however, always
to keep the ground when thus prepared sufficiently dry, and
experience has shown that tents when so arranged are lacking
in salubrity.

arrangement of a Crimean tent.
Another method is to employ a stove, the pipe of which, turned
downwards, enters the ground, forming the floor of the tent, and
laying horizontally, a few inches below the surface, is joined out-
side of the wall by a vertical section of pipe that serves as a
chimney. Stoves so arranged were also used by the English in
the Crimea. Only a small part, however, of the ground surface
is warmed, and very slightly, by this method, most of the heat
of the smoke being lost in the air, as when the pipe passes out-
doors through the canvas in the usual manner.
When with the army of the Potomac, in 1862, I became
<pb>
acquainted with a system of warming tents by heat transmitted
through the ground which was certainly not wanting in origin-
ality. The heating apparatus was called a California stove; and
if I regret my being unable to give the name of its inventors, it
is only just to myself, in view of the system of heating tents,
employed at the American ambulance, that I should say that the
system I am about to describe was never extensively used in the
American army. I remember having seen it adopted but in a few
instances, and in no case were the details of the installation alike.
1 may also observe that General Sheridan—and no one is
more familiar with American camp life than he—remarked, when
examining the system of heating adopted at the American ambu-
lance,—that "it was the first time he had ever seen an attempt
made to heat tents through the ground." 1
I shall describe two methods of applying the system, with
which I became acquainted in 1862. In the first the arrange-
ment was as follows:—A hole, about 18 in. deep and 1 ft.
square at the top and bottom, was sunk in the ground near the
centre of the tent; a trench was then dug, about 8 in. deep
and 1 ft. wide, from this hole to a point outside of the tent, and
2 ft. or 3 ft. from its wall; the trench was then covered with
flat stones along its whole length, except at the extreme end out
of doors ; over this open end a chimney of sticks was built up
1 Dr. J. J. Woodward, of the United States army, informs me that Surgeon D.
McRuer, formerly attached to the array of the Potomac, addressed on the 17th of
November, 1861, a letter to Dr. Tripler, then medical director of that army, in
which he recommended the warming of tents by means of a " California stove," and
asked for a commission of inquiry to examine the four hospital tents to which the
system had been applied in his own brigade; as also, that Dr. McRuer afterwards
received a sort of general commission authorizing him to visit the different camps
and instruct surgeons how to construct the stove. But Dr. McRuer was not the
inventor of the system he commended.
I am told by Dr. Eugene Sanger (now of Bangor, Me.), who was well acquainted
with Dr. McRuer, that the "California stove" had been introduced into his own
and other regimental tent hospitals at Lewinsville (army of the Potomac) some time
before the date of McRuer's letter. Indeed, the name given to the device—a
California stove—is strongly suggestive, not only that it was not, in 1861, a new
invention, but that it was one of those many ingenious conceptions which have been
suggested by the necessities of mining, trapping, or a rude life of exposure.
<pb>
with clay or mud to a height of 8 or 10 ft. The excavation in the
ground within the tent served as a fireplace; the trench formed
the horizontal part of the chimney. The top of the fireplace was
covered with a flat stone or a piece of sheet-iron, leaving only a
small aperture through which to introduce fuel and regulate the
draught, the strength of which depended principally upon the
height of the vertical chimney. A heating apparatus thus con-
structed, after having been used a day or two—the walls of the
fireplace and trench having been thoroughly dried and baked
—worked perfectly; the consumption of fuel was much less
than had a common stove been used, and the air within the
tent was maintained steadily at a most comfortable and agree-
able temperature.
The second method differed from the first in this respect, viz.,
the fireplace was outside of the tent, and not within it; the trench
was continued from the vertical chimney quite across the tent,
 
and terminated in an excavation in the ground in front of the
door, and a few feet beyond it. The excavation or fireplace
was shallow, and the fire lighted upon it burned to a large extent
in the open air, only a portion of the heat and smoke being
drawn into and through the trench. The tent, however, was
well warmed by this arrangement, which was less difficult to
manage than that first described. At the Exhibition in 1867, I
showed, by a model, how this system was applied to a tent.
The model is exhibited in the accompanying engraving, Fig. 45,
reproduced, with certain corrections, from a sketch which
appeared in the "Etudes sur l'Exposition de 1867," published
by M. Eugene Lacroix.
<pb>
The system I have described will be readily understood by
referring to the engraving. The fireplace (A), the chimney of
sticks (B), the trench (&), the flat stones covering the trench (a a),
are the essential elements of this very simple system or appa-
ratus, commonly called in American camps a " California stove."
The method represented in the sketch is the one to be re-
commended when two or more tents are united to form a
pavilion. When, however, more than one hospital tent is to be
warmed, it will probably be found necessary to deepen the fire-
place, as also perhaps to cover it over, so as to convert it into a
close fireplace or furnace; otherwise too little heat may enter the
trench to warm sufficiently the portion of the pavilion nearest the
chimney. By closing the fireplace a great economy in the con-
sumption of fuel would also be effected, a matter of small conse-
quence in America, but of great consequence in Europe, or
wherever fuel is obtained with difficulty.
The tent pavilions at the American Ambulance were heated by
an arrangement which was a modification or improvement upon
the method last described, a modification determined partly by
the consideration that our tents were erected en permanence, and
partly by the circumstance of our being in a great city where
it was possible to have any apparatus made which might seem
best designed to obtain the result wished—a suitable and uniform
temperature within our pavilions.
Beneath the first tent, at the northern end of each pavilion, a
cellar was dug about 6 ft. deep and 6 ft. wide; its length at right
angles to the axis of the tent was 8 ft. at the bottom, and 15 ft.
at the top; the walls were vertical on three sides; on the fourth
side, as the dimensions given will indicate, the wall had the form
of an inclined plane. This inclined plane was outside of the tent,
and was furnished with steps leading to the bottom of the cellar;
it was moreover covered, to keep the rain out, with a wedge-shaped
wooden roof. The cellar space beneath the tent was therefore
represented by an oblong solid 6 ft. high, 6 ft. wide, and 8 ft.
long, and its position under the tent may be said to have been
central and lateral ; that is to say, a section halving the tent
transversely, if prolonged, would halve also the cellar on a line
corresponding with its long axis, while the cellar extending 8 ft.
<pb>
under the tent, projected 6 in. beyond a section halving the tent
longitudinally.1 From this cellar, and along a line 18 in. distant
from and parallel with the long axis of the pavilion, a trench was
dug to a point about 2 ft. beyond the last tent, a distance of
76 ft. in the pavihon of six tents, and of 62 ft. in the pavilion of
five tents. The trench was 3 ft. 3 in. deep where it entered into
the cellar; at the distal end it was 16 in. deep; its bottom thus
formed a slightly ascending inclined plane. At the top it was
20 in. wide, and at the bottom 8 in. wide; it therefore represented
in section a blunt wedge. (See Plate IX. Appendix.) Having
thus prepared the cellar and trench, the heating apparatus was
introduced.
This consisted of a stove and certain accessories. The stove
was very simple in its construction; it was of cast iron, 28 in.
high, 18 in. diameter, and arranged for burning either coal or
wood. The stove was placed on the floor of the cellar, with its
back directed towards and against the open end of the trench; an
elbow of 61 in. pipe was adjusted to the chimney, the under
surface of the horizontal branch of the elbow resting on the bottom
of the trench; straight sections of 6^ in. pipe were now laid the
whole length of the trench to the point where it terminated—
2 ft. beyond the last tent; here an elbow was attached to the
pipe, which rose perpendicularly out of the ground to the height
of 13 ft., where it was crowned with a water cap.2 The appa-
ratus for heating the pavilion having been established in the way
described, a fire might have been built in the stove; the draught
would have been found excellent, and the amount of caloric thrown
into the tent altogether sufficient. The heat, however, would
have been very unequally distributed, as also subject to great
waste. To regulate its distribution, as also to economize it,
something more was necessary. The first thing done was to
1 I have here described the position of the cellar in pavilion No. 1; in pavilion
No. 2 the steps leading to the furnace were in front of the end of the tent, and not
at the side, and the cellar was under the vestibule, and not under the tent itself.
(See Plates II. III. and V.)
* A reference to the Plates accompanying this Report will make this description
perfectly intelligible. The cellar is indicated by the letter A, the trench by B, the
stove by a, the elbow by b, the horizontal section of pipe by the letters c r c c, the

<pb>
cover over a considerable part of the trench, beginning near the
stove. This was accomplished by inserting thin plates of iron
into the walls of the trench about 6 in. below the surface of the
ground, and covering them with earth (Plate IX.); 45 ft. of the
trench were thus covered over. The effect of this operation was
naturally to create an air-current, drawing most of the heat from
the stove into and through the trench, to the extreme end of the
pavilion, where it arose into the tents from the uncovered portion
of the trench. In order, however, that the heat might be intro-
duced directly into the tents (the three) nearest the stove, a
grated opening (register) communicating with the trench was
placed in the floor of each (Plate V); this could be opened or
closed at pleasure; when open, a portion of the hot air arose
from the trench directly into the tent; when closed, the hot air
was forced on to the next tent, where, if the register was also
closed, it passed to the next—until, in fact, it found a free open-
ing from which it might escape into the pavilion.
By covering a portion of the trench (the whole might have been
covered, but it was not really necessary), and by the introduction
of registers, a proper distribution of the hot air coming from the
furnace was provided for. To economize all the heat generated,
and to secure a constant draught of hot air along the trench,
and in the right direction, brick walls were built up around the
stove, completely enveloping it, except on the lower half of its
front, and except also, I should say, behind, where it was backed
against the trench (Plate III.). This envelope formed a sort of
air-chamber, and its object, as M. Brehan has very well said, " was
to force the exterior air to lick the metallic surface of the stove,
and take up a part of its heat, and thus send it into the trench,
where along its whole length the hot air is constantly in contact
with the stove pipe, which also adds to its temperature."1 To
the mouth of the brick envelope was attached a sliding iron door,
by which the air supply was regulated. To prevent the tents
becoming at any time over-heated by the current of hot air,
a cut-off, or damper, was placed in the trench 4 ft. from the
stove; it was simply a long thin plate of iron, attached to a
1 "Notice sur 1'Ambulance Americaine," submitted to General Morin, with the
Plates I. II. III. IV. V. and VI. accompanying this Report.
<pb>
perpendicular spindle; when open, its planes were parallel with
the long axis of the trench; on turning the spindle one quarter
of the way round, the plane of this plate being at right angles
with the axis of the trench, the trench was closed and the
current of hot air cut off. That the heat of the stove in this
case might not be wasted, in pavilion No. 2, an 8 in. earthen pipe
had been let into the top of the brick envelope, and laid in the
ground outside of the tent; this pipe ran under the nearest bar-
rack, into which it opened through a register placed in the
floor; the hot-air chamber surrounding the stove was thus con-
nected with a barrack in such a way that whenever the heat
generated by the furnace was more than sufficient for the
pavilion, the damper being turned so as to prevent the hot air
entering the pavilion, on opening the register in the barrack
the current of air from the furnace was let into that building.
Our heat was thus economized, and a considerable saving of
fuel effected.
I believe this general description of the heating apparatus used
in the tent pavilions of the American ambulance will be suffi-
ciently intelligible. I would, however, call your attention to
the Plates accompanying my Report (Appendix), which represent
with great exactness most of the details of this special instal-
lation. The explanations attached to the diagrams will cause
them to be readily understood.
tThe system of heating which I have here described was
found, when applied to our tents, to perfectly accomplish the
object had in view.
It was easy to maintain, by means of it, a temperature within the
tents comfortable and uniform in the coldest weather. Says M. Bre-
han, in the paper from which I have already made an extract:—
"The thermometer out of doors standing at 29° Fah., we found
the following temperatures existing within the tents at 5 ft. from
the floor.
"At the entry of the first tent (over the furnace) . 57° Fah.
„ ,, second .... 59° „
,, ,, third .... 61° „
„ „ fourth .... 59° „
„ „ fifth (farthest from the furnace) 55£° „
<pb>
The hot air as it issued from the first register—the one nearest
the stove—showed a temperature of 122° Fah."
This memorandum is interesting, showing as it does the uni-
formity of the temperature in every part of the pavilion. The
five observations show the average temperature to have been
58'40 Fah. and in no part of the pavilion did the temperature
at 5 ft. from the floor differ from the average to the amount of
3° Fah. I may remark, however, that M. Brehan observed
the temperature but on a single occasion, and when it was
below the average usually maintained, which was a little over
60° Fah.
Says M. Jolly:—" I have many times myself been a personal
witness to the fact, that during the rigorous month of December,
when the cold was ranging from 14° Fah. to 10° Fah. the tem-
perature within the tents was maintained from 54° to 59° Fah.
and that without forcing the fire."1 Often, however, I have seen
the temperature raised during the severest days of the winter
to 65°; indeed, we never had any difficulty in raising the tem-
perature to any desirable degree, and maintaining the same in
every part of the pavilion, so long as we were supplied with
fairly good fuel.
In this connection also it may not be uninteresting to learn
that, in the two tent pavilions erected in the garden of the
Luxembourg in imitation of our own (and in each one of which
the heating apparatus was an exact copy of that I have just de-
scribed) similar results were obtained as regards both the distri-
bution of heat and the steadiness of the temperature. M. Cottard,
the interne of the ambulance, reports that for about a month, from
the middle of February until the middle of March, he conducted
a series of thermometrical observations, noting the temperature
every two hours in different parts of each pavilion; and he states
that he found the variations of temperature very slight, and that
they were produced quite insensibly—" Les variations etaient
minimes et se produisaient insensiblement." The general average ,
temperature ranged from 56° to 58° Fah.
The only difficulty we ever experienced in heating the tent

pavilions dated from the time (January) when it became impos-
sible for us to obtain in Paris any fuel but coal-dust of the most
worthless quality, and greenwood from the Bois de Boulogne so
charged with water and with sap as to be nearly incombustible.
After this fuel had been used for a few days the draught became
defective on account of the condensation, in the more distant por-
tions of the smoke-pipes, of the products of the distillation rather
than combustion which was taking place in our furnaces. The
deposit left upon the pipes was highly hygrometric, and water
rapidly accumulated, particularly in the vertical sections of the
pipes; running down, it entered the horizontal portions of the
pipes, and soon flowed nearly to the fires. The result was
naturally an almost complete arrest of the draught, and a fall of
the temperature within the tent; coal smoke began even to enter
the tents in a manner very disagreeable. A partial remedy for
the evil—the defective draught—was found in burning out the
pipe (in each pavilion), and replacing it, after having attached
a receiving-box to the angle formed by the junction of the hori-
zontal and vertical sections; an opening was made in the lower
face of this elbow, that communicated directly with the box, the
bottom of which was also perforated, that the fluid running into
it might escape into the ground.
The arrangement will be understood by referring to Plate
IV., where the receiving-box indicated by the letter k may be seen
in its place. Although we never saw any necessity for the use
of such a box so long as we had either coal, coke, or dry wood
for fuel, our experience has proved it to be one of those acces-
sories which may prove most useful; at any rate, I would
recommend, whatever the fuel to be used, that the lower face of
the elbow be perforated with a few holes half an inch or an inch
in diameter, and that in laying the pipe a small cavity be left in
the earth immediately beneath these holes, at the angle of the
elbow. Such an arrangement would probably be quite sufficient
to prevent the accumulation of fluids in this part of the pipe.
Another practical suggestion I may be permitted to make. It
would greatly facilitate the cleaning or burning out of the hori-
zontal portion of the pipe, should it be necessary to resort to this
expedient, if small traps were cut in the pipe which could be
<pb>
reached from the openings in the floor in which the registers are
set. Such an arrangement would cause the interior of the pipe
to be always fairly accessible, and obviate the great inconveni-
ence of taking out the pipe each time it is to be cleaned.
Should it be proposed to give to the installation a character of
permanence—to organize a hospital for the winter—perhaps the
simplest and most effective method of securing a good draught
would be that of placing a small sheet-iron stove at the extremity
of the pavilion, near the vertical smoke-pipe, and fitted with a
two-inch pipe made to enter the smoke-pipe near the ground.
The occasional lighting of a small fire, the burning even of a
newspaper in this stove, would be probably all that would be
found necessary to secure for the furnace a sufficient draught.
I have said that the temperature within the tent was not
only sufficient but uniform, and I have partly explained how
this uniformity was obtained—by the sliding door at the
mouth of the brick air-chamber, which increased or reduced
the quantity of air brought in contact with the hot surfaces
of the stove, and consequently the volume as well as the rate
of movement of the hot air current; by the registers, esta-
blished at different points in the pavilion, which could be opened
more or less completely at will; and finally by the damper, which
enabled us to cut off entirely the hot-air current whenever it
might seem desirable. While the difference in the temperature
of the air in the several tents forming the pavilion was in no
case remarkable, it may have been observed that, according to
M. Brehan's memorandum, the two coldest tents were the first and
last—the one nearest the fire, and the one the farthest removed
from it. That the tent beneath which the furnace itself was placed
should have been colder than the others may seem at first re-
markable; the reason, however, is quite apparent. Most of the
heat of the furnace was driven by the air current into the trench;
the consequence was that the tent over the furnace was depen-
dent for a large part of its heat upon that given off by a slow
radiation from the stove, its brick envelope, and the warm earth
beneath it. Nearly all the heat developed in the stove was
swept into the trench by the current of air, and was either dis-
charged through the registers into the tents, or served to warm

a large mass of earth beneath the tents, and along the line
of the trench. Two important facts I may state: the cellar,
small as it was, was never hot; while the vertical piece of pipe
from which the smoke escaped, outside of the pavilion, was
always cold to the touch quite to the ground. We thus, while
forcing nearly all the heat to follow the course of the chimney,
lost no heat by the chimney. In fact, nearly every unit of heat
generated passed into the tents either directly or indirectly,
either as hot air, or through the ground by a slow radiation. I
have stated how we regulated the temperature in the pavilions.
The means described, however, were chiefly intended to equalize
the distribution of the heat. To equalize the rate of the heat
supply was an object not less important, and one which I have
already said within tents is attended with special difficulties.
This object was accomplished, as you may have already fore-
seen, by having on hand a large reserve of heat, that was con-
stantly, slowly, and steadily being discharged into the pavilion
along its own length. The hot air in its passage along the
trench gave up a portion of its heat to the earth, which in turn
gradually, by conduction and radiation, gave up its heat to the
floor of the tent, as also to the air within it. Sand, clay and
earth have a high capacity for heat, and, like all bodies possess-
ing such a capacity, are poor conductors of caloric,—that is to
say, yield up their heat slowly. The warm temperature within
the pavilion was therefore maintained partly by the direct intro-
duction of hot air, and partly by the evolution of radiant heat;
the air gave out its heat quickly; the earth gave up its heat
slowly; the air was a transient source of heat; the earth might
almost be said to have been a permanent source. If I may use
an illustration suggested by the laboratory, the warm earth be-
neath our pavilion bore the same relation to the air within it
that the sand bath does to the contents of a retort which the
chemist may be heating—it served to regulate the distribution of
the heat, as also, and more particularly, to equalize the rate of its
evolution. Had our tents been warmed solely by the introduc-
tion of hot air, it would have been impossible to have maintained
within them a steady temperature. Suppose the thermometer
out of doors to have marked 14° Fah. and within the pavilion to
<pb>
have marked 65° Fah., the pavilion being at the same time
dependent for its heat entirely upon a supply of hot air: on cut-
ting off that supply the interior temperature would have rapidly,
and within a few moments, fallen 5°, 10°, 15°, 20°, 30° (Fah.).
Now, when this difference existed between the temperatures
without and within, we found, that when the hot-air current
was entirely shut off from the pavilion, the heat entering the
tents by radiation and conduction from the hot earth maintained
the temperature within them for a long time above 50 Fah., and
that the rate of the refrigeration was so slow that hours must
have elapsed before the thermometer would have marked a loss
of 30° of heat.
I may now mention another great advantage obtained by
warming tents through the ground. It keeps the earth con-
stantly dry beneath the floor of the tents, or—no floors being
used—beneath the beds of the patients. The humidity which
may arise from the ground within tents has been with surgeons
a constant cause of fear as well as of complaint, and whenever it
may have been present it has most unquestionably neutralized in
a measure several of those good qualities which I have endea-
voured to show were peculiar to tents. By the employment of
a system of heating such as that used by us at our ambulance,
the surface of the ground upon which the tents stand will be
found to have soon become so thoroughly deprived of its mois-
ture as to cease to be a source of either danger or appre-
hension to anyone, whether patient or surgeon.
There is a close relation, as everybody has learned, between
the heating of an apartment and its ventilation. Whenever the
temperature of the air within a chamber is raised to a degree
above that existing in the air without, the natural ventilation of
the chamber is improved; in other words, the confined air es-
capes more rapidly by the windows, the doors, and other usual
apertures of the room, and is more rapidly replaced by the
counter-currents set in motion from without. As the ventilation
of all apartments in which men dwell is a subject of the greatest
importance, and as the means employed for heating them always
contribute to a certain extent to their aeration, efforts have been
made to so construct heating apparatus that they should accom-
<pb>
plish, at the same time and to the largest degree possible, two
objects: First,—the maintaining of a comfortable temperature
within the apartment occupied; and secondly,—a sufficient re-
newal of the atmosphere within it.
The relations of heating to ventilation have been most care-
fully studied, particularly within the past thirty years, by An-
giboust, Peclet, Ried, Duvoir, Morin, and many other scientific
men, and the practical as well as theoretical conclusions which
they have drawn from their experimental researches are not only
highly interesting, but of great value.
A consideration of this subject from a general point of view
would scarcely be in place in this Report. Nevertheless, the way
in which the air within our tents was expelled and renewed may
be more clearly understood by keeping in mind a few of the most
important facts connected with the general subject of ventilation.
There are commonly said to be two kinds of ventilation—natural
and artificial; that is to say, ventilation accomplished by natural
forces, and ventilation accomplished by forces created by art.
The walls of few rooms are absolutely air-tight, and gases
pass through them by diffusion, and more or less slowly accord-
ing to their porosity. But most habitable rooms are provided
with a variety of openings—doors, windows, and chimneys—and
where these openings exist diffusion takes place more rapidly.
Here the principal motive force is the difference in specific gravity
between the diffusing gases, or, to speak generally, between masses
of air having unequal temperatures. The wind, however, must
be counted as one of the most active natural ventilating forces.
It penetrates even solid walls, and everywhere exerts its influ-
ence by increasing the pressure of the exterior atmosphere.
The air within our railway carriages would often become dan-
gerously offensive but for the powerful action of the wind.
Of artificial methods of extracting the air from rooms, the
simplest illustration is a chimney with a fire in it. In this case
artificial heat is used as a motive force; the heated air ascends the
chimney with great rapidity, and extracts or pumps the air from
the room; while to re-supply that which has been extracted, a
corresponding amount of fresh air is drawn into the room through
various openings. But the outlet of the chimney in common
<pb>
apartments is not well placed, nor can it be easily increased
or diminished to better serve the purpose of ventilation. For
this reason it is found that shafts in which an ascending current
is created by hot-air pipes, or any simple heating apparatus, ex-
tract the air more uniformly, as their outlets may be placed above
the floor or in the upper part of the room, and may be opened
and shut more or less completely according to circumstances. A
certain correspondence, however, should always exist between the
position of the inlets and outlets for the air. Where the prin-
cipal inlets are windows and doors and the cracks beneath the
doors, the fireplace, as an outlet, is badly placed. Where, how-
ever, the inlets are from above, the fireplace may be well placed.
In fact, one of the best systems of ventilation, in which heat is
ased as an extracting force, is that known as reversed ventila-
tion, where fresh air is introduced from above, and the outlets
of the cheminies d'appel are on a level with the floor.1
There are two other well-known systems in which artificial
force is employed as a means of obtaining fresh air. One of
these has been called ventilation by insufflation, and the other
ventilation by induction. In the first system, fans are employed
to force a current of air into a large pipe furnished with
numerous small branch pipes for its final distribution. In
the second system, compressed air is discharged into pipes
by nozzles so arranged as to communicate with air ducts,
through which the air is drawn into the main pipes by rapid
and forcible jets of the compressed air. But mechanical devices
for obtaining a change of air, however ingenious they may
be, are generally very inefficient. The conclusion arrived at
by General Morin, after numerous experiments made at the
Lariboisiere (hospital), where the fan was used in connection
with the cheminee d'appel, was that the fan expelled about fifteen
per cent. of the air evacuated, and that the balance, eighty-five
per cent., passed out through the cheminee d'appel.2 In short,

Achard. Paris, Eugene Lacroix, 1865.
This also is the system most successfully adopted by General Morin for the
ventilation of the amphitheatre of the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers.

<pb>
the two methods of ventilation first mentioned—ventilation
through natural openings, and by extraction by heat—are the
most efficient methods now known for effecting a change of air in
rooms, and they are in principle the same; that is to say, the
motive force used in each is the difference of pressure between
the air within a room and the air exterior to it, a difference of
pressure which results generally and principally from a difference
of temperature.
One of the practical difficulties in ventilation has always been
to regulate the supply of fresh air: it is not only necessary that
the air of an apartment should be frequently changed, but it
must be changed regularly, and in such a way as not to give
rise to currents or draughts of air. Draughts are inevitable in
buildings where natural ventilation is resorted to. Draughts
are also inevitable in all apartments where the air escaping must
be replaced by air entering through a limited number of apertures
of a limited size; in these cases the rapidity of the moving cur-
rents will be inversely as the number and size of the openings,
and the inconvenience of the draught will be felt in proportion
as the apartment is small. Indeed, it is almost impossible to
maintain a proper degree of atmospheric purity in small apart-
ments, occupied by a number of persons, by means of natural
ventilation, on account of disagreeable draughts.
Of artificial methods of extracting foul air, the simplest, as I
have already remarked, is a chimney with a fire in it. But here
again, in the application of this system, particularly in small
apartments, we find it giving rise to draughts; and, notwith-
standing the great sensible movement, the air is often imperfectly
renewed, the currents sweeping along the floor, while the air in
the upper part of the room gets close and disagreeable.
A partial remedy for draughts is found in warming the air
which flows into apartments to take the place of that which has
escaped. The currents may still exist, but when the air has
been warmed they cease in a measure to be disagreeable.
Probably the best system of artificial ventilation for an
ordinary room is that which combines the evacuation of the
vitiated air by a shaft or cheminie d'appel, with a provision for a
corresponding supply of warm air. Unfortunately the evacua-
N N
<pb>
tion of the air is usually much more rapid through the shaft than
the injection of warm air, and, in consequence, the balance of the
air supply is drawn in irregularly through various openings.
This system in its simplest form was used in our tent-barracks.
A horizontal air shaft was laid under the floor; outside the bar-
rack it terminated in a vertical section which served as an inlet;
inside the barrack the shaft opened beneath a stove. This
stove was surrounded by a metallic jacket pierced with holes;
the heat of the stove, and the general evacuation of vitiated air
from the ward, caused a strong current of air to enter the shaft,
while the air was forced to pass around the hot surface of the
stove, before entering the ward through the openings in the
jacket. The cheminee d'appel was a vertical shaft which received,
and was heated by, the ascending stove pipe.
This method of ventilation may be occasionally wanting in
power, and its use is limited to the winter season; but for tem-
porary barracks in the winter, I believe it to be equal if not
superior to all other artificial methods of ventilation. It is
incontestably superior in two or three respects—it is simple aud
easily applied; it involves a very trifling expense ; 1 and, what
is by no means its least merit, it is sure to work in the direction
intended—a fact which will be appreciated by those who have
witnessed that special kind of ventilation renversee which is too
frequently incident to more complicated systems. This system
was employed in nearly all the American barrack hospitals, and
has been used perhaps more frequently than any other in the
German barracks since erected.
But to return to the ventilation of our tents. How was
this accomplished, and what relation to it had the system of
heating employed? It is very evident that they were indebted
1 It possesses a very striking theoretical advantage, to which, however, perhaps
too much importance has been attached; the shaft is worked by a force—heat—which
would be often otherwise wasted. In a resumt of the principles of artificial ventilation,
M. Jolly says :—" 5° On devra utiliser pour l'appel la fumee, c'est-a-dire la force
perdue du foyer servant a chauffer l'air nouveau." (" Traite Pratique du Chauffage,
de la Ventilation, &c.," par V. Ch. Jolly. Paris, 1869.) The principle is an excel-
lent one, but its value in any given case must depend equally upon the relative
cheapness of its application and effectiveness.
<pb>
for their ventilation almost wholly to the action of natural forces.
Strictly speaking, no artificial means whatever were used within
the tents either for the purpose of expelling foul air or of intro-
ducing fresh air. There were no cheminies d'appel, nor had per-
manent inlets for fresh air been provided. A strong current of
fresh air did at times enter the trench and escape as hot air
through the registers into the pavilions; but it should be ob-
served that this current of air was introduced for the purpose of
obtaining a more equal distribution of heat rather than for the
purpose of obtaining a supply of fresh air. As a source of fresh
air the trench was doubtless of service, but this service was
incidental. The hot air which came from the trench was neces-
sary to the maintenance of a uniform temperature through the
whole length of the pavilion, but it was not necessary to the
maintenance of atmospheric purity within the pavilion. Much, if
not most, of the fresh air which entered the tents, entered through
other channels. I have elsewhere stated that air can pass
through the walls of all habitations, and that it does so more or
less slowly according to their porosity. Sometimes this diffusion
takes place very slowly, as through walls of plaster ; it is more
rapid through walls of brick and wood; it is still more rapid
through walls of canvas.
The canvas of a tent, when interposed between two gases, is a
porous diaphragm, or septum; and if interposed between gases
of different densities, these would diffuse into each other in-
versely as the square roots of their densities. But aside from
this porosity or capillarity of canvas, which causes it to be every-
where permeable to air and gases, canvas is often largely pro-
vided with what may be called natural openings. An examination
of a piece of the best linen canvas shows it to be full of small
but quite visible apertures. The number and size of these
apertures vary greatly with the quality of the canvas, and it is
difficult to estimate the exact space they represent in any piece
of canvas; but it may be safely said that such apertures repre-
sent in their aggregate for each square yard of canvas an opening
rarely containing less than four square inches,1 and often exceed-
A square inch of French regulation tent-canvas contains on the average about
<pb>
ing a foot square. Suppose they represent an opening two inches
square in each yard of canvas; in a tent like the American hos-
pital tent, the walls and roof of which contain about 70 square
yards of surface, these little apertures would represent in the
aggregate seventy openings, two inches wide and two inches
long. Now, a room of a capacity equal to that of an American
hospital tent, although occupied by five or six persons, if pro-
vided with two windows properly disposed, of such a size as to
represent the aggregate surface of the seventy openings just
mentioned, could not fail to be well ventilated, if the difference
between the temperatures of the interior and exterior air was
20° or 30° Fah.—a minimum difference whenever it is necessary
to resort to artificial heat.
These statements will cause it to be understood why tents are
so much more susceptible of natural ventilation than ordinary
rooms. Indeed, it is not impossible that the question may have
occurred to you, why is it, if the small apertures represent in
the aggregate so large an opening, the air should so frequently
become close within tents when special means of ventilation are
not resorted to, when the walls are not raised, &c.? And this
leads me to observe: First,—that the size of the apertures varies
very much according as the canvas is wet or dry. After the tent
30 threads, crossed by 44 or 46 threads, and may be said to represent a pavement
composed of 1,300 or 1,400 little, not quite regular, squares. Now between many,
if not most, of these there are visible apertures or meshes. The number of these
apertures, plainly visible on holding a piece of this canvas between the eye and the
light, may be safely estimated at 800 per square inch. Their average diameter
cannot be less than of an inch—that is to say, the meshes occupy at least
of tho surface, and thus represent in the aggregate for each square yard of
canvas an opening containing 6-4 square inches. But French regulation tent-canvas
is of a fairly good quality. 1 have frequently seen linen canvas, used for making tents,
in which the holes between the threads represented nearly a quarter of the surface.
While these apertures are so very visible, and play no inconsiderable role in the
ventilation of tents made of linen, the meshes are scarcely visible in fairly good
cotton canvas. In a piece of American regulation tent-canvas which I have now in
my hands I cannot detect, even with a lens, a single opening through the canvas.
The meshes, therefore, in well-made cotton canvas, or, in other words, in an Ame-
rican tent, cannot be considered as contributing very much to its ventilation. The
canvas is permeable to air and gases, principally because, although unprovided with
many visible apertures, it is still highly porous.
<pb>
coverings are wet with rain or clew, as is often the case at night,
when ventilation is generally most required, these little apertures
are to a great extent closed up. Hence, as I have elsewhere re-
marked, the importance of employing a double roof, and, as I
may here remark, one of the advantages of warming tents, the
canvas being permeable to air very much in proportion as it is
free from moisture. Secondly,—the air generally escapes from
and enters into a tent or room much more rapidly through a few
large openings than through a great number of smaller openings;
and the principal reason is because the wind, which is one of the
most powerful of our ventilating forces, acts much more effectively
through large openings than through small openings. The force
of the wind is broken by the coarsest canvas, and although the
currents of air find their way through the small interstices of the
tissue, and thus assist in ventilating the tent, the volume of air
thus brought into a tent is much less than would be introduced
under the same circumstances through two or three open
windows of a moderate size. We must regard, therefore, the
little apertures visible in canvas of a fairly good quality simply
as outlets and inlets for the escape and entrance of air by
diffusion. Through them any gas confined within a canvas
covering will be diffused into the surrounding atmosphere, in
accordance with the law stated above. Now, gases at different
temperatures diffuse into themselves in conformity with the law
which regulates their diffusion at the same temperatures into each
other. As with simple gases, so the bulk of a mass of air varies
with its temperature. How much it varies we learn from
Regnault, who proved its dilatation to be for every degree of
Fahrenheit ^Tth part of its bulk; that is, 491 cubic inches of
air at 32° Fah. become at 65° 524 cubic inches, its volume
having thus been increased about 7 per cent., which percentage
also indicates its diminished density and its power of diffusion.
These statements concerning the mechanical qualities of can-
vas and the physical properties of air will indicate how the
ventilation of tents may be accomplished even when they are
shut up—by the simple diffusive power of atmospheres at different
temperatures. A canvas tent within which the air is warmed by
a fire is the best illustration which, can be suggested of effective
<pb>
natural ventilation. Neither special inlets nor outlets for air,
nor shafts, nor driving fans are needed ; the elevation of the
general temperature necessary for the comfort of those within
the tent in the winter season, with the free action of the wind
without, is all that may be required to maintain a ventilation in
every respect satisfactory—satisfactory, not only because it is
sufficient, but because it is accomplished regularly and without
draughts.
If a free ventilation can be secured without draughts in a tent
pavilion, it is because in canvas walls the openings are not large
enough to admit the air in currents, and have been uniformly dis-
tributed and vastly multiplied over a wide surface. No principle
of ventilation is more generally accepted or more frequently re-
peated by writers on the subject, than that the number of both
the outlets and inlets should be multiplied as much as possible.
"Hygiene demands," says M. Piron, "that the air should be
renewed constantly and insensibly—not through a large opening,
but through the greatest possible number of bouches—inlets—only
so large that the velocity of the air currents may in nowise
prove uncomfortable to the sick. This velocity cannot exceed
lm. 25 per second; for if moving at the rate of one metre per
second the wind is scarcely perceptible, at two metres per second
it becomes a light breeze." 1
If the openings through the canvas are very minute, the
number of the apertures compensates for the smallness of each,
and all that is necessary, in order to establish a circulation
between the interior and exterior atmospheres, is to create a
difference in their pressures, and this difference will always
measure the rapidity and completeness of the interchange—an
interchange which has been compared to the phenomenon of
osmosis, but which is more strikingly like that special inter-
change of gases which is constantly being accomplished through
the walls of the pulmonary vesicules, through which are diffused
in outgoing and ingoing currents, the gaseous products of re-
spiration, and the fresh air which is essential to life.
I feel confident, indeed, of the truth of my assertion,—that no

<pb>
system of heating a special dwelling has ever been proposed
which may have contributed more powerfully to the abundant
ventilation of the same, than did the system of heating I have
just described, and which was used at our ambulance during the
winter of 1870-71. When heat is introduced into an apartment
it warms the air within, and at the same time tends to ventilate
it. These two effects are the principal effects sought; to obtain
them we use our heat. The heat at any time present in the tent
pavilions served to make the air within them comfortable, and
at the same time, by rarefying it, powerfully contributed to its
rapid expulsion through the tissue of the canvas. The very fact
that the canvas, as I have before remarked, offered but a feeble
barrier to the escape of the warm air, became now an important
condition in the maintenance of the purity of the atmosphere
within the tents. That which, when the common means of heat-
ing tents are employed, is an evil—the rapid escape of the heat—
became, on the introduction of our system of heating, an un-
qualified excellence; we had heat enough to make the tents com-
fortable, and, in addition, enough to expel the foul air, and thus
make them healthful.
As I have said, nearly all the heat generated in the furnaces
entered the pavilion; the cellar was cool, the vertical smoke-pipe
was cool; very little heat was lost; nearly the whole amount was
necessarily used, either to warm the tents or to ventilate them;
and as the temperature within the tents seldom rose much above
65° Fah., it will be readily understood how powerful a motive
force we constantly derived from our furnaces, for the expulsion
of the air from the tents, and its induction from without.
But it has been sometimes asked:—" How do you know that
sufficient air enters by the doors, and, especially, that large
volumes of air pass out and in through the canvas, either
directly or by a sort of exosmotic and endosmotic action—that,
in short, your tents are well ventilated?"
One distinguished scientific gentleman said to me that he
should be much better satisfied about this matter, when the rates of
the expulsion of the air from the tents, and of its renewal within
them at various degrees of interior and exterior temperature, had
been determined by a series of carefully conducted experiments;
<pb>
and the gentleman left our grounds convinced, I presume, that
it was at least very probable we were deceiving ourselves as to our
air supply, because we could not furnish him with anemometric
tables in proof of our affirmations.
I have just spoken, and perhaps at sufficient length, of the
tendency of gases at the same or different temperatures to diffuse
into each other when not enclosed by impermeable walls. In
order, however, that the diffusive power of gases may be fully
exercised, it must in no way be obstructed; and whenever gases
are enclosed by canvas walls, those walls are certainly obstacles
which interfere more or less with the rapidity of their escape and
dispersion into the surrounding atmosphere. To what extent
the canvas walls of tents may hinder the tendency of the outer
and inner atmospheres to diffuse into each other,—or to express
the idea more clearly, at what rates, under the usual differences of
temperature, the air may pass out of a tent by diffusion, and how
many cubic feet of air may thus in return be supplied to each patien t
per hour, are certainly interesting questions. I may observe,
however, that it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to de-
termine with exactness the facts desired; and furthermore,
that if a quantity of air having been completely shut in by
canvas walls, the rates of its diffusion were noted at certain
exterior and interior temperatures, such rates of interchange
would be absolutely valueless as a means of establishing the
rates where the same conditions did not exist; and it is scarcely
necessary to add, that the conditions essential to an exact experi-
ment never obtain in tents, especially when in use. The conclu-
sions of transcendental mathematics are as inapplicable to special
cases as their premises arc absolute; logic, if less certain in its
premises, often opens to us the nearest and the surest way to
truth, and generally possesses the great advantage of being more
direct in its applications.
One fact is very certain; if the canvas covering of a tent opposes
in any way the free passage of air through it, it is, nevertheless,
exceedingly permeable; that it furnishes innumerable outlets
and inlets for air, is a fact revealed by the most careless inspection.
I shall therefore answer the question "How do you know your
tents were well ventilated?" as follows:—In the first place,—
<pb>
re-stating in a general way the inference from the physical properties
of the atmosphere and the qualities of canvas, because we know
the quantity of heat introduced into the tents was great, as also
that its escape from the tents was rapid;—now as cotton is not a
rapid conductor of heat,1 and as the canvas covering our tents was
a porous reticulated tissue, very pervious to air, it is more pro-
bable that most of the heat escaping from a tent passed out
with the ascending rarefied air, than that it was lost by con-
duction. In the second place,—it is highly probable that the
ventilation was sufficient, because odours were rarely perceptible
in the tents, and never were persistent. This is a fact of the
greatest importance. Chemistry furnishes few and poor tests
of the salubrity of an atmosphere; it can detect the presence of
few of those exhalations which have an organic origin, and which
are often, at the same time, the chief causes of insalubrity, and
perhaps the principal factors in what is known as an atmospheric
epidemic condition. The sense of smell does what chemistry
fails to do; it detects the presence of many of these exhala-
tions, and enables us to make a qualitative analysis of the air
in a hospital ward, sufficiently complete to permit us to pro-
nounce with tolerable certainty as to its purity. In the third
place,—because it is a well-established fact that typhus is a
disease produced by dwelling in an atmosphere greatly vitiated
by animal exhalations; now I believe I may safely say, that
an epidemic of typhus was never known to break out in a
hospital under canvas; in any event, typhus has rarely been
known to originate in such a hospital: it therefore follows that
within such hospitals, the air is not greatly vitiated by animal
exhalations. It should be observed, moreover, that the amount
of air space given to each person in a tent is necessarily very
small. An American hospital tent, when pitched, contains but
1,627 cubic feet of air; when five persons are placed in one,
1 Cotton wool is one of the best known non-conductors of heat. According to
Peclet, if the eonductibility of copper is represented by 04 00, that of sand may be
represented by 0-27; of carded wool, by 0-044; of cotton wool, by 0-040; of eider
down, by 0-0:39; and that of unsized brown paper, by 0 034. (Peclet, op. cit. pp.
105, 106, 107.)
<pb>
each has but 325 cubic feet of air; counting the air displaced by
furniture, &c., each patient has an air space of scarcely more
than 275 cubic feet. Now, if a number of persons were shut up
in a room, 14 ft. long, 15 ft. wide, and not 8 ft. high, and with-
out either windows or a chimney, we should naturally expect the
most serious consequences; such results did not follow when
the air space was thus limited in our tents: the inevitable conclu-
sion is, that the air supply was better—in a word, that the air
was being constantly renewed within them.1
As I have elsewhere spoken of the general means taken to
secure for the tents a sufficient fresh-air supply, by raising the
walls, and opening the doors and ventilators placed in the roofs,
it may not be necessary to again revert to them.
By means of the system of heating, adopted at the American
ambulance, a comfortable temperature was maintained in the
tents during the coldest and severest months of the winter; the
ground upon which they were pitched was deprived of its damp-
ness, and the air within them kept fresh and pure, to a degree
unusual in any hospital, and to a degree remarkable in view of
the small cubage of the pavilions and the large number of patients
and attendants constantly within them. I believe that a con-
siderable part of the success attending the surgical treatment
at our ambulance must be ascribed to conditions which could
not have been maintained within the tent pavilions, had any of
the usual modes of heating tents been adopted. I do not know
how it would have been possible to have secured by any other
system or apparatus such freedom from dampness, such a com-
fortable and uniform temperature, and a ventilation so perfectly
satisfactory. I cannot therefore insist too strongly upon the
special merits of our system of warming tents. The attempt
made at the American ambulance to treat the wounded under
1 As I have not noticed in this connection the existence, in the roof of each tent,
of a window (14 inches by 12), I may here observe that the windows were rarely
opened in cold weather. Then every crevice in the canvas was shut as tightly as
possible, and it was then also that the air within our tents was always the purest.
The windows and doors were only opened when the general temperature was rela-
tively warm, or when the heat from the furnace was in excess, to facilitate its
escape.
<pb>
canvas during the winter months, and in the belief that better
results might thus be obtained than could be hoped for, were the
wounded placed under the shelter of more substantial construc-
tions, undoubtedly seemed to many persons hazardous. The
experiment in its relations to military surgery was certainly one
of the most important which has ever been made, and an unusual
degree of interest has naturally existed among sanitarians to
know the final results. These results our surgeon-in-chief has
presented in his report.
I believe the world will pronounce them to have been even
more than satisfactory when compared with the results obtained
elsewhere in Paris. If this be the conclusion of those most com-
petent to judge—as to whether we succeeded or failed in our
attempt to treat the wounded in tents during the winter—I shall
again give it as my opinion, that our success in this respect
was largely attributable to the very effective system of heating
adopted.
Having described the heating apparatus, and considered its
merits as a means of warming and ventilating tents, it were perhaps
well if something should be said with reference to the economy
of using it. I have already alluded to the fact that very little
heat was lost. This economic fact, very important in view of a
permanent installation, may be of less consequence when the
installation is only temporary. The question in this case might
be, at what expense could the apparatus described be furnished?
As the cost of the apparatus will naturally depend somewhat
upon special circumstances, the question may best be answered
by the following statement:—
The cellar and the trench for each one of our pavilions were
prepared by our own attendants (infermiers). We consequently
paid nothing, directly, for the labour, which represented, perhaps,
the work of one man for three days. For each stove and the
accompanying apparatus, pipe, registers, brick-work, and the
labour of setting up the same, we paid out two hundred francs
(the labour may have represented one man's work for two days).
All the labour, however, connected with the work of preparation,
as well as of the installation, could very easily have been done
by five or six men in one day. The apparatus is one, conse-
<pb>
quently, which can be introduced into a pavilion of tents without
loss of time. It required on our part, a cash outlay of two hun-
dred francs, in one case, for a pavilion of five tents, in another, for
a pavilion of six tents. The average cost of the apparatus having
therefore been but thirty-six francs for each tent, the apparatus
must be considered as having been extremely cheap.
If the tents be pitched in the field, where stoves, iron pipe,
&c. cannot be obtained, and should it be thought desirable to
make use of the more primitive system which I have described
on a preceding page, the only cost it would entail maybe expressed
by the time or labour expended in its construction. Two or
three men in one day could very easily prepare the fire-place and
trench, and build the chimney for a pavilion of four or five tents.
With regard to the material, in this case, for the construction of
the apparatus, we may be quite sure that everything really ne-
cessary will almost always be found near at hand. It will rarely
be difficult to find a sufficient number of stones to roof over the
trench. In countries where stone cannot easily be obtained, clay
will answer for this purpose very well. If it be impossible
to obtain either stone or clay, the vertical chimney may be built
of turf or sticks plastered with mud, and the trench covered with
mud or turf supported by sticks, to within a distance of a few
feet of the fire-place. It will be necessary to support the earth
covering the remaining portion of the trench with scraps of iron
or some other incombustible material.
Water Supply.—A hydrant existing on the premises, it seemed
desirable for several reasons to have a water supply at various
points in the ambulance. Pipes were accordingly laid down,
which placed the hydrant in communication with each one of the
wards, as also with the kitchen. It is scarcely necessary to say
that, apart from contributing to the security of our property in
case of fire, and effecting a great saving of labour, the arrange-
ment contributed much to the comfort and well-being of our
patients, as also of our nurses.
The importance of having a sufficient supply of good water
near an ambulance, is so considerable as to have sometimes induced
writers to attribute to such a supply more of relative importance
than properly belongs to it among the several requisites of a good
<pb>
locality. Certainly, wherever water is unobtainable, it would be
impossible to establish an ambulance, and wherever the water is
unsuitable for drinking, it would be unwise to establish one.
But it is rarely difficult in most civilized countries to find, pretty
nearly everywhere, water which is fairly potable. Whatever,
in certain cases, may be the relations of water to health and
disease, as a rule, too much importance is popularly attributed
to the specific properties of certain potable waters; and Pinel
long ago very justly said:—" a residence in large towns, like
Paris and London, is apt to induce diarrhoea at first among
strangers, much less, however, on account of the water than
by reason of a combination of many other causes."1
The evil repute which has been attached to many waters has
often resulted from overlooking certain agencies, less apparent
but far more potential in their influence upon health. The water
at our ambulance was thus once pretty generally pronounced to
be the cause of a tendency to diarrhoea that declared itself.
This tendency was afterwards, I believe, quite satisfactorily
shown to have had another cause; not until, however, a large
filter had been adjusted to the hydrant, which subsequently
served the double purpose of clarifying the water, and re-
assuring such persons as had suspicions as to its wholesomeness.
The water used on our premises was that generally used in Paris.
Until within a few years, the drinking water of the city was
furnished almost entirely by the Seine. Even at the present
time, nearly half of the water daily used is obtained from this
source, and is issued to the public after having been mixed with
aqueduct water. The service of the aqueducts was interrupted
during the siege, and the population of Paris was reduced to
have recourse, for the most part, to the Seine for its water
supply. That there should have been a reduced consumption
of water during the siege is not remarkable, but the absolute
reduction was remarkably great; and not the least surprising
fact is, that even the amount of Seine water distributed was
scarcely more than half that usual in ordinary times, as appears

The water of the Seine contains solid matter, and, as is the
case with most rivers, in very variable quantities, according as the
waters are troubled by rains, freshets, &c. The solid matter per
litre, when the waters are most disturbed by the causes men-
tioned, amounts to as much as 5 decigrammes per litre, or 35
grains per gallon: it is, however, generally much less, and averages
only about 8 grains of sediment per gallon. According to
Letheby, the water of the Thames contains, during the winter,
on the average, 83 grains of sedimentary matter per gallon. It
is difficult to determine the exact quantities of organic matter in
any given measure of water, but the relative quantities present
may be estimated by the amount of ammonia in equal measures
of water. A litre of water, taken from the Seine just before it
enters the city, was found by Boudet, in 1861, to contain
0'000,08 grammes of ammonia; another litre, taken just after it
had left the city, was found to contain 0-000,28 grammes; and a
third litre, taken from just below the point where the sewers
discharge, was found to contain 0-002,30 grammes, or, in other
words, it contained about twenty-nine times as much organic
matter as the first sample.
The principal mineral which enters into solution in Seine
water is the carbonate of lime, derived from the chalk formation
<pb>
through which the river passes. This carbonate is present in the
water in the proportion of about 10 grains to a gallon.
The following analysis of Deville shows the minerals and the
amounts of each contained in 100 litres of Seine water:—
Silica . . . 2-44 grammes. Chloride of sodium . 1-23 grammes.
Aluminium . . 0-05 „ Sulphate of potassium . 0-50 ,,
Nitrate of soda . 0-94 „
„ magnesia . 0-52 „
Oxide of iron . . 0-25
Carbonate of lime . 16-55
,, magnesia. 027
Sulphate of lime . 2-69
Total weight . 25-44
A large proportion .of the organic matter in the water, as well
as a certain part of the mineral matter existing in the water not
wholly in a state of solution, is precipitated by standing in the
reservoirs before distribution, as also by the partial filtration to
which it is there usually subjected. During the siege, however,
a large part of the water, used even for drinking purposes, was
distributed without having been filtered.
I do not know if French opinion, whether popular or scientific,
concerning the special qualities of the water of the Seine, has
much changed since the time of Parmentier, who replies to all
the objections which can be raised against its use, by saying:—
"The constant wholesomeness of the water of the Seine has been
the subject of numerous theses sustained in the universities; its
good effects have been celebrated by the most distinguished poets;
the immortal Boerhaave, a most respectable authority, felicitates
the Parisians on the possession of a water which unites all the
qualities which could be desired to make it agreeable to the
palate, light in the stomach, and favourable to digestion. In
fact, the Emperor Julian in his time expressed the same opinion,
which, indeed, has always been confirmed. . . . The Parisians
are therefore not wrong if they regard themselves as favoured by
nature, if they never end their eulogiums of the Seine, if they are
proud with the delight of seeing it divide their city, if they con-
tend, in short, with assurance, that this river is the most admir-
able of all rivers, and its waters the best of all waters." 1

1787; p. 8, et passim.
<pb>
If it might be difficult to justify all these praises, it would
certainly be equally difficult to prove that the waters of the
Seine act, or have ever acted, in a general way prejudicially to
the public health.
Apart from the supply derived from the Seine, Paris is usually
chiefly furnished with water from the Ourcq. The waters of this
stream are charged with magnesian salts, and have been thought
of doubtful salubrity.1
The water from the aqueduct of the Dhuis also exhibits the
presence of a larger amount of mineral matter than the water of
the Seine. Paris was deprived of water from these two sources
during the siege.
I do not believe the practice of obtaining directly from the Seine,
and near or within the city, a large portion of the drinking water
served to the population of Paris, is a commendable one. Still,
until some conclusive evidence is offered that it is inferior to the
average drinking water of modern cities, we must conclude not
only that our ambulance had a sufficient water supply, but that
it had a tolerably good one as well.
Kitchen.—The kitchen (Plate 1, No. 8 P>.), was a room 17 or 18
ft. square, and contained two 30-gallon boilers for making soup,
two ranges, a table, side table, and shelves for the necessary
utensils. It was supplied with water from the hydrant. I do
not know if this establishment was in any way remarkable. Like
the barrack wards it had no ceiling, and as only a single thick-
ness of canvas was used to close the opening under the eaves,
the kitchen was always rather distinguished for the excellence of
its ventilation. It was one of the first constructions erected, and
was centrally placed—a matter of much imjiortance, not only for
convenience sake, but because the food sent from a kitchen so
situated, is more likely to reach the patient in a proper state.
The service of our kitchen was well performed by a head cook,
two aids, and several subordinates.
Wine Room.—This room (Plate 1, No. 7 G.), was used as a store
room for the ordinary wine, which was here bottled for daily
distribution and use.
Michel Levy, " Hygiene," tome i. p. 811.
<pb>
Provision Store.—(Plate I. No. 8 C.) The meat and provi-
sions were here kept in store; those for the day were also here
weighed, and afterwards sent to the kitchen.
The supervision of this room and of the wine room were con-
fided to the same person.
Linen Room.—This room (Plate I. No. 10 A.) was in the
extreme end of barrack No. 10, and separated from the office of
the superintendent by a thin canvas partition, the door through
which was almost constantly open; it was thus kept warm and
dry, while the character of the construction itself encouraged a
free ventilation. No room connected with a hospital stands
more in need of a well assured ventilation than that in which the
linen is stored, and I could not better explain the reason than by
translating a passage from a paper written by M. Emile Michel.
"The linen room," says that writer, "was almost the only
dangerous spot in the Polygon; to have kept it from leaking,
it should have been built more hermetically tight than the
other barracks. The linen brought back imperfectly washed and
not entirely dry, in spite of all the instructions on those points,
kept up a muggy and insalubrious atmosphere, which the
draughts of air established whenever the weather permitted, were
powerless to change. Several employes, some female domestics,
and the sister of charity charged with the superintendence,
fell sick there one after the other. A young man attached to
this service died a victim of his assiduity at this dangerous
post.
"The same sad results showed themselves elsewhere—in several
other ambulances—at Metz; and it was frequently that we were
compelled to regret the sickness or the death of persons appointed
to a service which, being less exposed, seemed sheltered from
every peril." 1
Our linen was washed principally at a laundry in the suburbs
of Paris. In the month of December a washing-machine was
established behind barrack No. 8, and certain articles were after-
wards washed on the premises, employment being thus furnished
for one woman.

Store Room.—(Plate I. No. 17 A.) This room was used
principally as a dep6t lor mattresses and bed sacks, and the moss
(crin veg&tal) and sea-weed which were used to fill the bed
sacks and pillows. But few hair mattresses were used in the-
ambulance, sea-weed and moss having been almost exclusively
employed to fill both pillows and bed sacks. Whenever one of
these articles became soiled, the contents were removed and
burnt, either wholly or in part, while the sack, after having
been washed, was refilled. One person was almost constantly
employed in this room in preparing and refilling mattresses and
pillows.
Knapsack Room.—Very soon after the opening of the am-
bulance, the need was felt of having some secure place where
the effects of the soldiers could be stored. A room was set
apart for this purpose in one of the first barracks erected, but, as
the room was soon required lor other uses, a larger room (Plate I.
17 B.) was especially arranged as a store room for knapsacks,
clothing, arms, &c. The effects of each soldier were ticketed,
and placed in separate compartments. The door of the room
was kept locked, and the window was protected by a grating.
Money, watches, and articles of special value were placed in a
safe kept in the administration room.
Operating Room.—This room (Plate I. No. 7 A.) was in the
southern end of barrack No. 7, and was well lighted by a large
broad window, nearly as wide as the room itself, that fronted the
south, as also by an ordinary window in the western side of the
room. The entrance from without was through a door, guarded
by a vestibule; a door also communicated with the adjoining ward,
to which, after severe operations, the patients were frequently
transferred. The furniture of the room consisted of a large heavy
operating table, one or two small side tables, and two or three
racks attached to the walls, to receive bottles, dressings, &c. The
operating room was warmed by hot air, taken from the trench
of pavilion No. 4. In describing the system of heating, I said
that it was occasionally necessary to shut off the hot-air current,
by closing the damper placed in the trench behind the furnace;
whenever this was done, a quantity of heat was lost. Barrack
No. 7 being near the furnace of pavilion No. 4, it was suggested
<pb>
'that it might be worth the trouble to place the trench in com-
munication with the barrack, so that when the hot air was shut
off from the pavilion, it might be turned on to the barrack and
thus utilized. The suggestion was adopted, and proved to have
been a valuable one.
Dormitory.—A small building (Plate I. No. 19) was erected to
serve as a dormitory for the male nurses. Most of the persons
employed as nurses, whether males or females, slept out of the
ambulance, but a few not having rooms in town, and that they
might be accessible at any moment, were provided with quarters
on the ground.
Transport Service.—The stable (Plate I. No. 18 A.), the shed
(Plate I. No. 18 C), and the salon (Plate I. No. 17 C), were
created rather in the interest of the field transport service, than
as dependencies of the ambulance proper.
Baths.—If no bath room was established on our ground, it
was not because we under-estimated the importance of baths in
connection with hospitals. Our ambulance, at first an assem-
blage of a few tents only, was intended to be used as a field
hospital; subsequent circumstances somewhat changed its cha-
racter, until it was transformed into a sedentary ambulance. After
the tents had been pitched it grew up gradually by the addition
of constructions, one after the other, in an order determined
strictly by necessity. Fust, the latrines were made, then the
kitchen, next the rooms A, B, and C, in barrack No. 10; then
barrack No. 7; afterwards the rooms C, D, and E, in barrack
No. 8, were built; and thus additions were made until the middle
of February, when the last construction—the kiosk over the
coffee wagon—was completed.
The presence of a bath-house on the ground at no time seemed
to be indispensable—1st, because the permanency of our occu-
pation was never assured; 2ndly, because, with the existing
scarcity of fuel, the expense and difficulty of keeping it con-
stantly ready for use would have been great; and 3rdly and
principally, because baths could be otherwise obtained.
In the house used as an annex to the ambulance—or rather,
forming a part of it, were several bath rooms, which were at our
service. Portable baths, prepared according to the French
<pb>
custom, were also occasionally brought into the ambulance from a
neighbouring etablissement de bains} A very large number of our
patients—who, it will be remembered, were nearly all wounded—
were most of the time not in a condition to take general baths.
Recourse, therefore, was commonly had to local bathing, which
was systematically practised in the case of each patient. Great
attention was paid to the subject of personal cleanliness; and one
of the first duties of the nurses, before putting the patient in bed,
was to see that so much of his person was washed as the condi-
tion of his physical strength permitted. Together with frequent
spongings of the surface of the body, such baths were daily
repeated, and, while in a large number of cases the only kind of
bath it would have been possible to have employed, they
answered nearly every hygienic end that could have been
secured in a bath room itself.
Perhaps I could not quote, in support of the truth of this
opinion, a better authority than Miss Nightingale, who—{retrans-
lated from French into English)—speaks upon the subject
of baths as follows:—" The skin can be kept cleaner with a glass
of warm water and a rough towel, than with soap, sponges, and
the whole apparatus of a bath, without rubbing. The sick, even
on a long journey, when they could not be removed from their
beds, and a large quantity of water could not be obtained in a
basin, have in this simple way been kept as cleanly as if they had
had at their disposition all the conveniences of home."2
Sinks.—If cleanliness is of the greatest importance in all
hospitals, by reason especially of sanitary considerations, it is
perhaps a condition which should be regarded as still more in-
dispensable in a field hospital. Here opportunities are con-
stantly occurring where the rules of the administration may be
violated with impunity, while the inmates of such a hospital
always feel as if they were, to a certain extent at least, free to
act without reference to laws of conventional propriety. Unless
1 Nearly every one, however, of the public bathing-houses of Paris was closed
before the end of November, from the impossibility of obtaining the necessary fuel.

<pb>
a place for everything, as well as means for doing everything,
are carefully provided, no amount of doctrinal instruction will
prevent many things being done "which ought not to be done,"
or result in a service which is not, at least, inefficient—perhaps
intolerable. In a word, it will never do to let the servants of a
field hospital manage the police service themselves, on a simple
order that the tents and grounds are to be kept constantly neat
and clean. The refuse matter of various kinds, dirty water, &c.,
should all be disposed of regularly and systematically, each kind
of refuse in its appointed place.
Among the things most likely to infect a hospital are soiled
articles of clothing. These should be removed from the wards
as quickly as possible. Linen that can be cleansed by wash-
ing should be taken to the dirty-linen room, from which it
should be sent without delay to the laundry; all textile
articles which may not be worth cleansing, or which may
have been so soiled as to render them possible vehicles of
contagion, should be burned. In the corner of our ambulance,
near the latrines, a small furnace had been placed for the pur-
pose of accomplishing the necessary incinerations. Near by, a
deep trench was opened: here the dressings, and the water
soiled during the dressings, were daily buried; protosulphate of
iron was also thrown freely into the trench; when filled,
another was opened by the side of it. In each ward there
was a metallic sink immediately beneath the water-cock, into
which it was permitted to throw soapy water, soiled by the wash-
ing of hands, etc. ; this was conducted by pipes into the street
whence it ran into the common sewers. Behind the kitchen was
a deep square pit, which served as a sink for the kitchen; this
was covered by a trap, and communicated through a pipe directly
with the street sewer. All the garbage from the kitchen was
removed regularly from the premises by the scavengers. To
dispose of any kind of refuse, in any other way than that espe-
cially provided for it, was positively forbidden. The general
police of the grounds was maintained by two men, charged solely
with this work.
This service, if apparently simple, is one of the most difficult
of execution connected with a camp or field hospital; it requires
<pb>
of the servant some labour, but principally watchful care; he
must be constantly on the alert, and pretty nearly everywhere
present, if he would not have the first "inspector/' or chance
visitor, unpleasantly anticipate him in his discoveries.
It is only justice to Mr. Meaks, who directed this service
towards the close of our ambulance, to state, that he was the only
person who ever succeeded in giving to it a practical efficiency
which left absolutely nothing more to be desired.
Latrines.—The difficulties connected with properly establish-
ing and properly maintaining these offices in civil constructions
are well known. If in camps and field hospitals the difficulties
are less in certain respects, they are in other respects even greater.
A proper sanitary condition must be maintained by constant dis-
infection, or by a frequent removal of the offensive accumula-
tions, while the installation itself must necessarily be simple.
Again, the careless habits of troops are to be taken into con-
sideration, and effective measures employed to guard against
them.
In American camps and field hospitals the custom has been to
establish, at a point as far removed from the tents as convenient—
generally at a distance of about two hundred yards—a trench ten
or twenty feet long, two feet wide, and six or eight feet deep,
before which is placed a bar resting on cross sticks. This instal-
lation is screened with shrubbery. Each day, during the time
the trench is in use, a few shovelfuls of fresh earth are thrown
into it, until it is filled up, when another similar trench is opened.1
Very rarely have any so-called "disinfecting agents" been used
in these camps and hospitals; nevertheless, the system adopted
is really one of disinfection. Common fresh earth acts power-
fully as a deodorant when thrown, even in small quantities, upon
1 De Presle, in an essay preliminary to his translation of Monro's " Account of the
Diseases which were most frequent in the Military Hospitals of Germany," says :—
"The fosse should be dug deep and narrow, its length depending upon the number of
troops in the camp; it should be 15 or 20 ft. deep, and 8 or 12 ft. wide; and one or
two pieces of wood should be put up at the edges to prevent accidents. Every morn-
ing, a layer of earth, about afoot deep, should be thrown into this fosse, which, when
thus filled to within 3 ft. of the surface, should be filled up entirely, and another
fosse opened near by."
<pb>
fsecal matter, while it possesses the advantage over all other
deodorants of being everywhere obtainable at little or no ex-
pense. The disinfecting properties of earth depend upon its
power to absorb and fix gases. It acts in this respect precisely
as charcoal does, and if not quite so effective, theoretically, as
that agent, is much more so practically, as its use is less fre-
quently limited by considerations of cost. It may be inferred
from a certain Levitical ordinance that the special properties
of fresh earth to which I allude were long since known.1 It is
very certain, however, that it is only recently that they have
become so well known as to lead to any systematic effort to
utilize them in the interests of public health and public comfort.
The completeness of the deodorization obtained in the "earth-
closets," so extensively used at the present time in private resi-
dences both in England and the United States, leaves really little
to be desired. The special advantages of this system over the
"water-closet" system, from an economical point of view, do not
now concern us.
Fresh earth is certainly one of the best, if not the very best,
disinfectant that can be used in a latrine trench;2 hence the
American system, which is also the one common to most armies,
is a good one, and not only especially appropriate for field service,
but one which fully responds to the object had in view, except
when cholera or pestiferous disease in a camp or hospital may
cause the trenches themselves to become sources of special in-
fection. In this event recourse must be had to disinfectants,
which, acting chemically upon the contents of the trenches, may
destroy any existing germs of disease, or interfere with the con-
ditions necessary to their development.
The employment of earth, however, as a disinfectant was not
1 The ordinance referred to would scarcely seem to have been original with
Moses. Injunctions quite identical are to be found in the Hindoo Shastras, from
which some curious extracts relating to the subject may be found in Gordon's
"Army Hygiene," pp. 486, 487.
- The capacity of a given quantity of earth to take up gases is very much in-
creased by drying it. So the natural capacities of earths vary considerably. Soils
which contain humus, clay, and marl, commonly known as loams, are in the highest
degree absorbent, while sand and gravel are feeble absorbents of gases.
<pb>
attempted at our ambulance, and if I have spoken at some length
of such an employment, it is because, had our ambulance been
established in the field, we should certainly have used the
trenches described, and probably depended entirely upon the
deodorant properties of the soil near by for their disinfection.
Trenches, however, could not be used, as the ground plot
which was given to the Committee was small, as well as unsuit-
able, from its town surroundings, for such installations; while,
had we adopted the "earth-closet" system, we should have in-
curred, in consequence, expenses for special apparatus, and ex-
penses additional on account of the necessarily increased bulk of
vidanges, to be removed at a fixed price per cubic foot—outlays of
money which, at the time, we did not feel justified in making.
We concluded therefore to adopt another plan—to employ a
number of fosses mobiles, and maintain a proper sanitary con-
dition of the latrines by frequent removal from the premises of
all faecal and urinary matter.
The place selected for the latrines, if determined to some ex-
tent by considerations over which we had no control, was never-
theless, perhaps, the best that could have been chosen. Partly
shut in by trees and shrubbery, it was not in immediate proximity
with any pavilion, and was yet not far removed from the court
of the ambulance and the doors of the wards. It occupied a
position at once central and out of the way. Its relation to the
wards and principal offices may be seen by consulting the Ground
Plan of the ambulance.
The cabinets, six in number, were arranged in a circle, and
separated one from the other by partitions six feet high and five
feet wide, all radiating from a central post; over the partitions
was placed an hexagonal roof. In the angles formed by the par-
titions, cylindrical zinc boxes—the fosses mobiles of the Com-
pany Le Sage—each having a capacity of perhaps twenty gallons,
were sunk into the ground the proper distance. These boxes,
armed with handles to facilitate their removal, were also each
provided with a funnel-shaped, wide-lipped basin. A resting bar
was placed from partition to partition about sixteen inches from
the ground, and a little above and in front of each basin. Fifteen
inches above this bar, and two or three inches behind it, was
<pb>
placed another bar, the importance of which will soon be ex-
plained.
A seat was substituted for the lower bar in two of the cabinets,
which were reserved; in other respects, except in having been
furnished with doors, they were arranged in a manner conformable
with the description.
In front of the cabinets were placed screens, arranged in a
double series, so as to serve the purpose for which they were
erected, and at the same time leave the way open to the en-
closures within.
A ground plan of the installation I have described is shown in
Fig. 46, which will give a very correct idea of the position of

The urinals were zinc cylinders capable of holding thirty gal-
lons, and provided with side basins, as also with handles for their
removal. They were three in number, and stood upon the ground,
side by side, between the cabinets and the first line of tents, shel-
<pb>
tered on three sides, and exposed on the fourth side, which fronted
upon the path leading from the court of the ambulance to the
cabinets. The exposed position of the urinals was intended to
contribute to the propriety of the cabinets.
It is generally understood that whenever it is possible to
separate the urinal from the cabinet this should be done. But it
is of great practical importance, in order to secure the chief object
of the separation, that the urinal should be at the same time the
nearest and the most visible office. It is singular how frequentlv
this simple rule is neglected in the construction of latrines. It is
probably to be ascribed to the fact that the " systeme dwiseur" as
it is called, was originally proposed rather for the purpose of
separating matters which possessed a certain intrinsic value from
those possessing less, than from any influence it might have upon
conditions of salubrity and
cleanliness. But a disposi-
tion of the urinal such as I
have indicated protects the
cabinet against its first and
most frequent degradation.
Whenever it is possible to
place the cabinet at a dis-
tance considerably more re-
mote than that of the urinal,
it is very seldom that the two
offices are misappropriated;
and nearly equal security
against misappropriate usage

difficult to reach the cabinet
without passing by the urinal, so exposed as that it must attract
attention.
The misappropriate use of the cabinet to which I refer, and the
wet and uncleanly condition of the bar or seat, resulting from
such a use, leads inevitably to another evil—that of climbing
upon the bar or seat instead of sitting upon it, and thus still
farther soiling and degrading a place which should always be
kept most scrupulously clean, not more from sanitary considera-
<pb>
tions than as an evidence of respect for the maxims of common
decency and common courtesy. Standing upon the seat of the
cabinet is even a graver abuse than the one to which I have just
alluded, as it is utterly impossible to keep a cabinet in a cleanly
state when daily used in this manner by a considerable number of
persons. Without the most constant watchfulness on the part of
the attendant it would become an abomination. Such a cabinet
will always more or less be abandoned, with the result of most
unpleasantly increasing the difficulties of policing the grounds
around, and of maintaining the encampment itself in a state such
as shall not do violence alike to the laws of propriety and of
sanitary science.
Unquestionably the first cause of standing upon the seat is the
evident uncleanliness of the place; another cause is a fanciful fear
lest a direct contact of the seat with a certain portion of the per-
son may communicate specific forms of disease. Another cause
is custom. The principal and practical cause is the facility with
which the custom can be adopted when no mechanical measures
are taken to prevent it. I regret to say that—so far as my ex-
perience may be taken as a guide—the causes I have mentioned
are superior to all ordinances, whether general or special, which
may be issued for the purpose of preventing this abuse in
cabinets open to the public. Constant vigilance on the part of
the attendants may remedy the evil, but it does not prevent it—
indeed, I know of nothing which can effectually put a stop to
this practice, which does not render any and every attempt to
execute it physically impossible. One might almost be tempted
to believe that if a round bar, two or three inches in diameter,
was substituted for the conventional seat, it would be difficult to
realize the position referred to. The difficulty, however, will be
found to depend entirely upon the length of the bar and the
absence of proximate support. In camp the long bar answers
very perfectly its purpose in this respect. In town, or wherever
it is for any reason desirable to restrict the limits of the latrine,
the bar will speedily be discovered to be no insurmountable
obstacle. Indeed, the only way to cause the seat or the bar to
be used properly is to fill up the space behind it, to such an extent
as to render standing upon the same, a la turque, impossible.
<pb>
This may be done by sliding a shelf, or placing a bar between the
lateral walls of the cabinet in such a way that a line between
the anterior edge of this bar and the front of the seat or lower
bar—fifteen inches below and two or three inches in front—shall
form the base of an angle of 70° or 80°, the apex of which shall
rest upon the posterior border of the basin. Such a disposition
is shown in Fig. 47, which moreover exactly represents the
system adopted in the cabinets attached to our ambulance.
When a bar is placed between the two sides of a cabinet, as
represented in the woodcut, it will not be found to incommode
in the least whoever may have occasion to sit upon the lower bar,
while it will baffle the most persistent efforts to assume with the
feet on the lower bar any half-standing, half-sitting position.
I consider that the use of this second bar or shelf furnishes one
of the simplest as well as one of the most effectual methods of
preventing the most frequent cause of the degradation of public
cabinets. Indeed, almost the only objection which can be offered
against the employment of the upper bar is that it forces who-
ever would use the cabinet to sit upon the seat even should it be
soiled. But when the urinal is separated from the cabinet and
located properly, as I have already indicated, the cabinet itself
will rarely bear the marks of misusage; a very little attention on
the part of the attendant will certainly be sufficient to constantly
keep it in a state of irreproachable cleanliness.
I should hardly have alluded to the possible soiling of the bar
in a specific way, or rather, to the apprehension said to exist in
the minds of certain persons upon this subject, whenever com-
pelled to make use of a public cabinet, but for an observation
made to me by a French surgeon after he had examined the
system adopted at our ambulance. "Yes," said he, "you keep
your cabinets in this way very clean; but are you not afraid
your system may occasionally be the means of transmitting dis-
ease?" My reply was:—" Not in the least. I am not aware
if the diseases to which you refer are less frequent in my own
country than in yours; but the idea that they may be con-
tracted in the way to which you refer is considered absurd by our
medical authorities, and so far as my knowledge permits me to
speak, is rarely entertained by the people." But the observation
<pb>
was nevertheless significant. I believe the opinion that specific
diseases may be contracted in cabinets d'aisance is very much
more generally entertained in France and Southern Europe than
in England and the United States. If the too-frequently dis-
gusting condition of these offices in French towns is in any way
dependent upon this fact, I can only hope the people may soon
be better informed. Well-founded fears of disease—those based
upon a connaissance de cause—may exert a wholesome influence
upon society; but absurd fears are, as in this 'case, generally
productive of evils far more serious than those from which
immunity is sought.1
The installations which I have here described as those adopted
for our cabinets and urinals, answered most satisfactorily the pur-
pose for which they were designed. They were simple, they
occupied little room, and the kiosk in particular always had a
neat and tidy appearance on the outside which rarely failed to
represent that on the inside. Outside respectability may be 'in
itself of little consequence, but it usually exerts a reflex influence
upon the state of things within too considerable to be neglected,
even in the establishment of latrines.
An attendant was required to visit the cabinets and urinals
several times each day, to see that they were in order, and to
remove from them whatever might be offensive to the sight.
Each forty-eight hours the cylinders were themselves removed by
agents of the Company Le Sage, and replaced by empty and
clean ones. This frequent removal of the contents of the fosses
—which were scarcely in use except during a part of the year
when the processes of decomposition were controlled by almost
constant frosts—rendered systematic disinfection quite unneces-
sary, although from time to time a little chloride of lime or
protosulphate of iron was thrown into the fosses, or upon the
1 Since this portion of my Eeport was written I have seen a statement (in
"L'Etude sur la Construction des Ambulances Temporaires ") that:—"In the
Prussian barracks the latrines have seats with transversal bars above them to force
those using them to sit down." I never saw such seats in use in any barrack or
hospital establishment previous to their having been adopted at the American
ambulance. The paragraph quoted contains also the first written allusion to the
use of the transverse bar which T have ever seen.
<pb>
ground in the neighbourhood of them. The ground around was
moreover every few days sprinkled over with fresh gravel, for
the double purpose of keeping it dry and clean.
Dead House.—This building was erected in an extreme corner
of the grounds; it was also shut oft- from the public by a screen.
A single room (Plate I. No. 16) was set apart for the dead; it con-
tained a post-mortem table, and was lighted principally from
above. The room adjoining (No. 15) was used as a depot for
soiled linen. The two rooms were ventilated by long narrow
windows, placed horizontally immediately beneath the eaves;
they were almost constantly open, and were protected by iron
gratings.
The positions of several of the installations, which, if considered
as necessary dependencies of the establishment, were still per-
haps remarkable in no special respect, may be seen by referring
to the Ground Plan accompanying this Report.
 
 
]N constructing an ambulance two important points are to
be considered.
1st. The suitableness of the construction for the pur-
pose it is to serve.
2nd. The cost of the construction.
Whenever the word ambulance is restricted in its signification
to those hospitals immediately attached to an army, and which
are intended to follow it in its movements, the suitableness of
the construction—other things being equal—must be determined
by its transportability. Our experience has shown us that results
may be obtained when the wounded are placed under tents as
satisfactory as those obtained in permanent and sedentary hos-
pitals especially constructed for their treatment. The great
advantage therefore which the tent hospital has over such hos-
pitals, whether built of stone or of wood, is its transportability.
It is far easier to move tent shelter sufficient for a thousand men
<pb>
a certain number of miles, than it is to transport a thousand
wounded men an equal distance. Moreover, as 1 have before
observed, the transportation of the severely wounded is attended
with such risks as render it one of those extreme measures
which never should be had recourse to except in the absence of
suitable shelter near the battle-field. Again, an ambulant hos-
pital possesses a special advantage too important to be over-
looked in this connection. It begins its work afresh on every
new field.
After a hospital has been established a certain length of time, it
becomes more or less impregnated with the specific exhalations
attending the processes of decomposition, as well as emanating
from the subjects of disease, and the hospital itself soon begins
to act as a morbific agent upon its inmates. Sanitarians are
quite unanimous in assenting to the truth of this statement when
applied to permanent hospitals. If this special evil and cause
of disease may exist in temporary hospitals in a less degree, it
nevertheless exists. Generally in temporary army hospitals, the
means and the organization lor maintaining that irreproachable
cleanliness required by the laws of sanitary science are much
less complete than in permanent establishments; such hospitals
are consequently likely to become much more rapidly insalubrious.
Whenever tents are employed in the construction of such a
hospital they form practically a camp; and it will be found im-
possible to entirely avoid those causes of pollution which it is
notorious speedily render camping grounds unwholesome.
I believe that one of the principal causes of the success ob-
tained in the United States, when the sick and wounded were
treated under tents, is the fact that the tents seldom remained
more than a few weeks upon the same ground. If they had
been erected for the shelter of the wounded, when these had all
been properly cared for, the tents were struck and sent away,
leaving behind them nearly everything—the earth, the floors,
the straw bedding, &c., that might have become a source of
infection had the hospital been long maintained.
It should be particularly observed, that if our own tents were
established on the Avenue de l'lmperatricc en permanence, we
always had it within our power to pitch them elsewhere, had it
<pb>
for any reason seemed expedient; we also had taken special
measures to protect our material as well as our grounds from
the common sources of infection in hospitals and camps. And
it should also be observed, that if in making our experiment it
was an object to show that men could be successfully treated in
the autumn and in the winter under tents, in maintaining them
upon the same ground for more than six months, and in re-
ceiving within them convoys of wounded from September until
February—thus mingling together the newly wounded and the
convalescent, those whose systems were broken down by ex-
posure and want of food, and those received when the vital
power of the army of Paris was at its maximum—we subjected
our tents to an unusual test.
The question of cost is one of great practical importance—is
second only to that of suitableness in the construction of an
asylum for the sick. I have remarked elsewhere that the use of
public and private buildings for hospital purposes was apparently
expedient for economic reasons. I am not able to say what the
average cost of transforming such buildings into ambulances may
have been in Paris during the siege. It jwobably was not
great; but when compared with the expense of any special con-
struction for the use of the sick, that incident to the purchase
and installation of tents is very small.
The tent shelter we employed at our ambulance cost us less than
100 francs per bed; and by this statement I mean to say that the
original outlay or first cost was less than 100 francs per bed. As,
however, our system of hospitalization was a mixed one, since we
used both tents and tent-barracks, and as our barracks were
mostly erected for' office purposes, and thus indirectly increased
the capacity of the tents, it is better perhaps that I should present
an estimate of the expenses incident to the establishment of a
complete and independent hospital under American tents.
Suppose this hospital or ambulance to contain fifty beds. An
American hospital tent is not overcrowded when it contains five
beds—at least this number may be considered as a suitable
average for each; we should consequently require ten hospital
tents. We should also require for the attending surgeon a
shelter—an "officer's" tent; also for the stores and material of
<pb>
the ambulance another tent of nearly or quite the same size;
and for the attendants, two small common (" wedge ") tents.
Such an allowance of shelter would be found to be quite
sufficient for the establishment of an independent hospital of
fifty beds.
The cost of such an installation may be approximately stated
in francs as follows:—
francs. francs.
Ten hospital tents at 462-89 each,1—Amount 4,628-90
Two officers' „ 400-00 „ „ 800-00
Two common „ 150-00 „ „ 300-00
Total, 5,728-90
According to this statement, the average expense of the
shelter for each bed would amount to 114-55 fr. If, however,
floors are laid down in the tents, should it be necessary to
purchase these, the expense will be increased about five francs
for each bed. The expense of putting in a heating apparatus,
should the season require one, if like the one emjJoyed by us,
would involve an additional outlay of 7-27 fr. per bed. The
maximum expense, therefore, necessarily incurred in the esta-
blishment of an ambulance of fifty beds, under such tents as we
employed, would not exceed 126-82 fr. for each bed; while
the minimum expense, should the surgeon and attendants be
provided with quarters elsewhere, and should we be able to dis-
pense with the purchase of floors and of a heating apparatus,
would be but 92-56 fr. The average expense therefore in-
cidental to the establishment of such a tent-hospital may fairly
be estimated not to exceed the sum of 109-69 fr. per bed.
The economy to be effected by using tents in place of perma-
nent constructions, in the establishment of a hospital, may be
made perhaps more evident by a reference to the usual cost of
such constructions. The Chestnut Hill Hospital at Philadelphia,
1 Contract currency prices at New York, July, 1870, reduced to gold and to
francs. These prices are in excess of present prices; and there is little reason to
doubt that such tents could be now made in France-at a cost 30 or 40 per cent, less
than that which appears in the statement. The cost of manufacturing tent coverings
has been quite fully discussed in Part II., to which I would refer the reader.
<pb>
erected on the pavilion or barrack system, contained 3,320 beds.
It cost the sum of 1,250,000 francs, an average of 376-50 fr. for
each bed. The location of each bed in our own tent-barracks,
although most economically constructed, cost over 200 francs.
The barrack-hospital erected on the American plan at Passy,
by the administration of the ambulances of the press, involved a
total outlay—including that for a part of the furniture—of
540,000 francs; as there were 420 beds in the hospital, the cost
of each was nearly 1,300 francs.
The tent barrack-hospital organized in the park of St. Cloud,
in June, 1871, by the French " Societe de Secours aux Blesses,"
involved an outlay of over 200,000 francs. It contained 200 beds.
The shelter for each bed, therefore, cost over 1,000 francs.
An examination of the expenses incurred in the construction
of the celebrated hospital Lariboisiere, the model civil hospital
of France, shows an average outlay for each bed of the enormous
sum of 10,982-20 fr.—or more than one hundred times the sum
expended in providing the shelter for a bed at the American
ambulance—not including the expenses of furnishing the hos-
pital, which involved an additional outlay of 990-09 fr. per
bed.1 But enormous as is the cost of a bed at the Lariboisiere,
it sinks into insignificance when compared with the estimated
cost of a bed in the new H6tel-Dieu of Paris. This building is
intended to contain twenty-five wards, and to be occupied by
400 sick. Over 13,000,000 of francs have been already expended
upon unfinished walls; the system of heating and ventilation is
to cost 1,200,000 francs; and the total cost of the establishment,
when con^leted, is estimated at 45,000,000 of francs—an average
of 112,500 francs, or over 22,000 dollars for each bed! It is not
surprising that a popular journal should have suggested that the
1 L'Hopital Lariboisiere cost the administration of the city of Paris—

<pb>
model of this hospital was designed tor distressed millionriaires,
and that the medical press should have never ceased to pronounce
it "a detestable hospital." Notwithstanding the immense sums
already squandered upon this building, it is evident that what-
ever the amount of money expended upon it, it never can, from
its surroundings and the principles of its construction, serve but
very imperfectly the purpose for which it was created.1
It is hardly necessary, in advocating the general employment
of tents in the construction of field hospitals and sedentary
ambulances, that I should discuss further the economy of such
a measure as compared with any which may have in view the
construction of special shelter for the sick, since no one can deny
that the tent affords, nearly everywhere, by far the cheapest
means of establishing such shelter. Xo one can deny, moreover,
that its transportability is an advantage in its favour of the
greatest practical importance. Indeed, the only question which can
be raised is this, viz., are the results obtained, when the sick and
wounded arc placed under tents, as good as those afforded when
they are treated within the wards of a permanent hospital? As I
have already considered this question at length, I can only express
the hope, in closing my Report, that the facts bearing upon it which
I have presented, derived partly from our own experience and
partly from the experience of others, may have appeared so con-
clusive as to induce you to believe, as they have caused me to
believe, that when the hospitalization of the sick and wounded
under tents shall have become an accepted and general practice,
a veritable reform will have been accomplished in the sanitary
service of armies—a reform not greater, because it would
diminish the suffering and mortality to which armies are fre-
quently subjected, from the complete absence of suitable shelter,
1 A commission of the Society of Physicians and Surgeons of the Hospitals of
Paris, appointed to visit and report upon this hospital, after a careful inquiry and a
long discussion, voted unanimously, on the 6th of January, 1872, the following reso-
lution :—" The new Hotel-Dieu, such as it has been built, is arranged in a manner
absolutely contrary to the first principles of hospital hygiene." This monumental
hospital is still unfinished, and it has been recently proposed to turn it over to the
Government, to be converted into a General Post Office,
<pb>
than because it would place the organization of the hospital
under the control of the surgeon, and enable him to realize
everywhere those hygienic and nosocomial conditions which a
long experience has taught us are of the greatest importance
in the treatment of the sick.

OF THE AMERICAN
AMBULANCE.
BY JOHN SWINBURNE, M.D.

<div id="of the american ambulance;on the surgical history" code="5" wordcount="39569">
International Sanitary Committee.
Sir;
S the causes which brought us together have now
no existence, and as the work of the American
ambulance is nearly finished, and I am about to
leave Paris, I deem it my duty and also my privi-
lege to lay before you in as concise a manner as
possible the surgical history of the ambulance, that through
you, the general, and medical and surgical public may become
possessed of all matters of moment which have occurred during
my administration.
You may remember that my connection with the ambulance
commenced on the 7th of September last. At that time all the
tents were pitched in the position which they afterwards held;
their location, surroundings, and the material of which they were
manufactured, met with my hearty approval; and when the
floors, drains, and heating apparatus were added, 1 considered that
nothing more, in a sanitary point of view, was to be done. Bar-
racks were subsequently constructed, adding two large airy
wards for the reception of wounded men, while other portions
were set apart for the dispensary, surgeon's office, operating-
room, post-mortem-room, and many other offices which did not
come under my supervision.
In short, when complete, the hospital was nearly perfect, leav-
ing little to be desired either as a flying ambulance or a perma-
nent institution.
<pb>
Resume oi' the General Treatment oe Wounds in
the Ambulance.
FTER the extraction of all the foreign matter possible—
including such fragments of bone only as might have been
detached from the periosteum—the wounded regions were
covered with several folds of cloth, in the form of a compress,
dipped in warm water. This was enveloped in some impermeable
material, such as oil-cloth, cotton, or silk. In some instances,
sheets of thin india-rubber, which is equally impermeable, were
used as a substitute ; though this objection has been urged, that
it is a good heat conductor, and hence becomes readily cold on
moderate exposure to the air. If this objection has any weight,
the difficulty can easily be obviated by covering the rubber with
any non-conducting material. The dressings were made daily—
when necessary, twice a day—care being taken that no part of the
dressing was used a second time, if not thoroughly washed and
purified.
The wounds were carefully washed, cleansed, or injected with
dilute carbolic acid or the preparations of chlorine. Dilute
alcohol was sometimes used. The first agent was also used in
stronger solutions to deodorize the dressings.
The wounds when unhealthy, or not sufficiently active, were
stimulated with nitric acid, of the strength of one hundred and
twenty drops of strong acid to the quart of water. This solution
was also applied to swollen and oedematous parts with seemingly
good results. Sulphate of copper was also used—one to two
drachms to the pint of water—the proportion depending upon
the condition of the parts requiring stimulation.
Warm water applications, oil-cloth coverings, &c., either hi the
form above indicated or in the shape of linseed poultices, have
<pb>
been used in inflammatory action, or when pus was forming,
with great comfort to the patients.
In flesh wounds, after full suppuration had been established,
the parts were properly supported by compresses and bandages,
to prevent the accumulation of pus or other matter.
To keep the dressings still further free from offensive odours,
the parts were constantly surrounded with oakum, which acted
simultaneously as a compress, disinfectant, absorbent, and
deodorizer.
Opium, morphia, and chloral, were given in various forms
to assuage pain and to produce quiet and sleep; valerianate of
zinc to allay nervousness; chloroform and ether were used as
anaesthetics; desiccated alum, perchloride of iron, and ergotine
were applied to arrest haemorrhage; iodine was locally used to
reduce any thickening, as well as in certain abnormal conditions;
soap and water, or molasses and water, were generally employed
for injections; laxatives consisted mainly of rhubarb, seidlitz
powders, purgative lemonade, citrate of magnesia, castor-oil, and
black-draught.
In compound and comminuted fractures, to avoid the accumu-
lation of pus and other matters in the tissues surrounding the
wounded parts, india-rubber drainage tubes were introduced and
retained until the parts had so far healed as to obviate the neces-
sity of their further use. Through these tubes, warm water,
dilute nitric acid, dilute carbolic acid, dilute alcohol, weak
chlorinated waters, or any other deodorizers, purifiers, or
stimulants, can be easily injected, as the case may require.
These have the double effect of freeing the parts from decom-
posed tissues, blood, pus, or other discharges, and of washing to
the surface any debris of devitalized bone or other foreign
matter, the presence of which might be prejudicial to fragments
of bone still covered by and adherent to the periosteum.
There is nothing so destructive to newly-forming or formed
plastic matter, or to a periosteum, the circulation of which is
enfeebled by violence done in crushing the bone and tearing-
its blood-vessels, nerves, &c., as the presence of large accumu-
lations of putrid, offensive, and acrid discharges, imprisoning
as they do sloughs and other foreign matter. If to this are
<pb>
added great shortening of the limb from spasmodic contraction
of its muscles, and the compression and arrest of circulation
at the seat of and surrounding the injury, frequently occa-
sioned by the surgical appliances—those enveloping the entire
limb, such as impermeable coverings of plaster of Paris, felt,
pasteboard, &c., or any other surgical apparatus for restoring
and maintaining even an approximation to the normal status of
the fractured limb—we have, I apprehend, all the conditions
necessary for delayed reparation of the injury, to say nothing
of the almost constant bony necrosis which ensues, and which
is a prolific cause of death.
In order that cleanliness might be properly effected and main-
tained, the clothing and bedding, when soiled, were immediately
replaced by that which was clean and fresh.
The barracks and tents—in order to carry out as far as
possible all hygienic measures—were from time to time emptied
of their occupants, and thoroughly fumigated with chlorine gas,
disengaged on an extensive scale, and somewhat in the following
manner :— Several large vessels or dishes were placed at equal
distances along the centre of the tent or barrack, as the case
might be, containing equal quantities of peroxide of manga-
nese and common salt moistened with water. The tent or
barrack was then closed, and a sufficient quantity of strong
commercial sulphuric acid was thrown simultaneously into the
vessels. Immediately the ward was filled with thick vapours
of chlorine gas.
After the chemical action had fully subsided, the board floors
were taken up, the ground cleaned, swept, and covered with
sulphate of iron, and the floor replaced.
The floors, when swept, were from time to time sprinkled with
a mixture of sulphate of iron and sand, which was allowed to
sift through the crevices to the ground ; occasionally a solution
of permanganate of potash was used instead.
Ventilation was effected by a combination of means, but
chiefly by a constant current of cold air passing over a heated
surface, and thence along a trench under the floor of the tent,
thus also keeping the ground and floor perfectly warm and dry.
From this source the air re-absorbed moisture, of which it had
<pb>
been deprived in its passage over the heated surface, and was
then distributed to all parts of the tent, displacing the foul air.
Geneeal Surgical Treatment of Compound Fractures.—
As injuries of the long bones and their joints are frequent and
often of great gravity, it is not surprising that differences of
opinion should have existed among eminent surgeons as to the
most feasible plan of treatment which would save the most lives
and give useful limbs.
The treatment adopted at our ambulance was in the main such
as I have laid down in a report of surgical experience in the
treatment of compound fractures during the Peninsular Cam-
paign of 1862, read before the Medical Society of the State
of New York in February, 1863, and again substantially reite-
rated in February, 1864, in an article discussing the proper
mode of treatment of "compound and comminuted gunshot
fractures of the thigh, and the means for their transportation."
In the article referred to the treatment is stated as follows:—
Injuries which necessitate amputation.
"1st. In cases where the artery or arteries are destroyed, or
so lacerated as to cut off circulation below the wound, and
gangrene is the inevitable result.
"2nd. In cases where a limb is torn nearly or quite off, as by
a solid shot or any other analogous missile, leaving an irregular
or ragged stump.
"3rd. In cases of extensive injury to the soft parts alone,
where gangrene would be likely to follow from the loss of the
principal nerves or arteries.
"4th. In certain cases of compound and comminuted fracture
of the knee and ankle-joints. The passage of small balls which
do not shatter or open the joints do not necessitate amputa-
tion, and particularly is this true of the ankle-joint. Compound
and comminuted fractures of the femur, or tibia, which extend
into the knee-joint, require amputation."

the shoulder and elbow-(joint) being the principal parts upon
which that operation should be practised.
"2nd. If the head of the humerus is shattered by a gunshot,
excision is the only remedy. If the comminution extends to the
shaft, the loose portions only which are deprived of periosteum
need be removed, the residue should be left to granulate. If
the glenoid cavity is crushed, its loose spiculte can be removed
or its injured portion gouged out.
"3rd. If the elbow-joint is crushed or comminuted by a ball,
excision is the only remedy. If the injury is confined to the
articulating end of the humerus, remove it, but do not disturb
the ends of the radius or ulna; if the injury be confined to the
articulating ends of the radius, or radius and ulna, remove
both, but not the humeral articulation.
"If the articulating ends of the humerus, radius and ulna
are crushed, remove them all. What is meant in the books by
partial excision is the removal of a portion of the joint, such as a
part of the humeral articulation, or the articulating end of the
radius or ulna only.
"The removal of the entire half of the joint results in a new
articulation, and not in anchylosis, as is often the case in partial
excision. If the comminution extends to the shaft of the
humerus, or radius, or ulna, remove its loose spiculae, and
leave the rest to nature.
"4th. In comminuted compound fractures of the carpal end of
the radius, or radius and ulna, excision of the articulating ends
affords the most reasonable prospect of success. Leaving it to
nature is far preferable to amputation. Never amputate for this
injury.
"5th. Compound gunshot injuries of the carpus or meta-
carpus seldom, if ever, require either excision or amputation.
Remove the loose bones, and treat as a simple wound.
"6th. In compound gunshot injuries of the phalanges, ex-
cision can be practised only with varied success, owing to the
<pb>
size of the bullet and the smallness of the member. The rule is
to save as much as possible. Injuries to these parts sustained
by buckshot or pistol balls do not, as a rule, require amputation.
On the contrary, most of them can be saved.
"7th. In compound and comminuted injuries of the humeral
shaft, excision or amputation should never be performed. The
loose spiculae should be removed, and the case treated as an
ordinary compound fracture. If, however, the comminution
extends to the articulation, it (the articulation end) should be
excised with the loose spiculae, while the fragments of the shaft
which still retain their periosteum should not be disturbed.
"8th. The same rule applies to the shaft of either or both
bones of the forearm. In all cases avoid constriction by ban-
daging.
"9th. Cases of compound, or compound and comminuted gun-
shot fractures of a portion of the femur, not involving the
knee-joint, ought to be treated as hereinafter detailed, viz., by
simple extension and counter-extension—making the stretcher
the splint.1 (See Fig. 50.)
"10th. Cases of compound and comminuted gunshot fractures
of the tibia, or tibia and fibula, not involving the knee or ankle-
joint, should be treated as above stated for the femur.
"11th. Simple gunshot injuries of the ankle-joint do not
necessitate amputation, while compound and comminuted frac-
ture of this joint, and particularly when the arteries are much
injured, may require amputation; though with proper support,
water-dressings, irrigation, free incisions, &c., a great majority
of these cases will recover without operative interference.
"The rule applicable to gunshot wounds of the hand is also
applicable to those of the foot; and I can safely say that there is
scarcely a bullet wound of the foot which requires amputation.
I have seen the whole scaphoid bone carried away, and still
a good recovery take place. So the destruction of the astragalus
may occur, and still recovery go on favourably. See the case
of Garibaldi, in whose ankle-joint a ball remained for some
months without unfavourable results.
1 This diagram is essentially the same as shown in Fig. 54.
<pb>
"12th. In compound and comminuted gunshot injuries of the
tarsal and metatarsal bones the same rule of action should be
adopted as in like injuries of the hand, with the exception, that a
slight deformity is not of such importance in the former as in
the latter.
"13th. No excision or amputation should be performed in the
second or inflammatory stage.1 If the operation cannot be per-
formed before this stage sets in, we ought to defer operation
until the truly second, or suppurative stage, appears."
In military surgery, the necessities of war compel the surgeon
to conform his treatment to the exigences of the occasion as
much as possible. This is particularly true in cases of gunshot
fracture of the leg and thigh. It is said that the transportation
of soldiers after amputation of either of these members is less
troublesome than before, whatsoever form of support is given to
the limb. Insomuch, therefore, as active warfare requires the
constant movement of armies, it behoves us, as surgreons, to
improvise means whereby fractures can be placed under treat-
ment while on the field, or as soon after as possible, before the
soft parts are irreparably injured by being torn and cut by the
sharp ends of the broken bone in the process of transportation.
The treatment should be continued without any violent change
which would endanger life or prejudice the results.
If this can be done without deranging or increasing the
embarrassment attendant upon the transportation of wounded
men; if means can be adopted by which compound fractures
can be safely transported—no additional burden being imposed
upon the ambulance trains; if, at the same time, the appliances
necessary for the treatment of such fractures and those requisite
for transportation can be so simplified as not to increase the
labour of the surgeon, we have, I apprehend, the solution of the
question at issue. For, in my opinion, the whole subject is
summed up in the word transportation.
It is now proven beyond a doubt, that when wounds of this
character are placed under treatment, before too much additional

the first and second stages of authors.
<pb>
injury is done in the process of transportation, if proper surgical
treatment is adopted, a larger number will recover than from
amputations, and that, too, with sound and useful limbs.
By what plan, then, can all these ends be accomplished? The
answer is simple, and the treatment is equally so. There are
always supposed to be a sufficient number of stretchers on the
field, and if not, a few additional ones can be supplied. Ex-
perience shows that the number of gunshot fractures of the
thigh and leg not involving the knee-joint is very small in
comparison with the great number of flesh wounds of the lower
 
Fig. 50.—Stretcher arranged for the transportation and treatment of a case of
compound fracture of the leg or thigh. During treatment the foot of the
stretcher can be elevated to make the weight of the body the counter-extending
force, and thus temporarily release the groin from the pressure of the perineal belt.
extremities. During the War of the Rebellion in the United
States, there were, up to a certain period, thirty thousand gun-
shot injuries of the lower extremities, of which less^than five
thousand involved the shaft and knee-joint.1
Suppose that each fracture of the leg or thigh were repre-
sented by a stretcher, this would not materially add to the
difficulty of transportation.
To the ordinary American or French stretcher I would add
two semi-circular spurs of iron, each having at its end an iron
ring, so made as to fit the handle of the stretcher, and provided
1 See "Circular" No. 6, S. G. 0., 1865, p. 30.
<pb>
with a thumb-screw. One spur is slipped on the handle of the
stretcher by means of the ring, and is fastened at the proper
angle by the thumb-screw. From this spur, extension can be
made by attaching a piece of cord to the sole of the foot. The
loop is made by extending adhesive plaister from the knee
down one side of the limb and around the foot. The other spur
is placed on the other end of the stretcher. From this, counter-
extension can be made by the perineal belt. In order that there
may be no misconception of the plan proposed for the trans-
portation and treatment of compound fractures, I append a
sketch (Fig. 50) of a person under treatment on such a stretcher.
This stretcher, therefore, becomes the bed, the vehicle for
transportation, and the splint for the treatment of the fracture.
The wounded man, after being properly dressed on the
stretcher—extension and counter-extension having been made—
need not of necessity be transported until the limb is consolidated.
If thus dressed, the patient can be carried any distance, stopping
as often and as long as circumstances may require.
On this stretcher the wounded man can be borne with perfect
safety to the limb, by hand, in cars, in boats, or in ambulance
waggons built to receive the litter, or even in common freight
railway waggons, provided they are so arranged that the weight
of the body may rest upon the extreme ends of the stretcher.
In this way the elasticity of the wood from which the stretcher
is constructed is utilized, and the bruises or injuries avoided
which might ensue from the shocks and jolts produced by the
roughness of the road over which the carriage passes. No
number of consecutive stoppages, either for hours or days, could
in any way interfere with the process of restoration, provided
the man be as well cared for as at first, and not removed from
the stretcher.
In the treatment of fractures by this method, all necessary
sanitary measures can be employed. Without the least possible
delay, trouble, or change in the surgical appliances, or derange-
ment of the injured limb, the patient with his bed can be
removed from whatever may be offensive or insalubrious to any
place where the most approved sanitary and hygienic measures
can be adopted; while any soiling from discharges of blood,
<pb>
pus, urinary, or faecal matter, can be washed from the canvas
covering of the stretcher on which the man lies, without doing
violence to the injured limb.
If at any time it becomes necessary to use the stretcher as a
means of temporary treatment during the transportation of the
fracture, the perineal belt can be dispensed with and counter-
extension be continued by raising the foot of the stretcher.1 This
may seem paradoxical; but when the principle is examined it
becomes undeniable. It is upon this plan that I have for many
years treated fractures of the thigh, whether simple or compound,
and at whatsoever point the fracture may have been located.
In 1849 an article was published by me in the "Transactions
of the Medical Society of the State of New York," describing the
manner and mode of treating fractures of the thigh by exten-
sion and counter-extension. The principles were the same as
those indicated above, with the exception that in making the ex-
tension, when the bed was used, the head and foot of the bed
were made use of in place of the semi-circular spurs described
as applicable to the stretcher.
Again, about 1859, I published another article in the "Trans-
actions" of the same Society, recommending the treatment of all
fractures by simple extension. I have followed this plan of
treatment with unvarying success, with such modifications as the
circumstances required. The result has been that in simple
fractures of the thigh the longitudinal and lateral distortion were
so slight as to be with difficulty discovered on inspection, or even
by measurement.
When wounds or excoriations existed which prevented the
use of the perineal belt, I adopted the expedient of raising the
foot of the bed, thus converting it into an inclined plane, against
which the weight of the body would rest and act as a counter-
extending force, obviating the necessity of a perineal belt.
Long after the publication of the articles referred to, and
after this treatment of fractures had proved successful, Dr.
Gurdon Buck, of New York, conceived the idea of carrying out
this principle by using weights and pulleys as the extending
1 See Cases 3 and 134, pp. 592, 596.
Q Q
<pb>
force, and of effecting counter-extension by means of a small
elastic india-rubber perineal belt. He also encircled the thigh with
short longitudinal strips of split deal, which were sustained by
thin elastic india-rubber bands. This he called Gurdon Buck's
method of treating fractures—a very delicate kind of pro-
fessional plagiarism, since, unless the principles involved in this
practice were new to him, he was hardly disposed to give credit
to him to whom credit was due. I had the satisfaction, however,
of seeing many persons treated in the New York Hospital by
"Buck's method," and found that the results did not compare with
those obtained by permanent extension; and that while no lateral
distortion existed, the shortening from overlapping was too great
to be consistent with a simple fracture. I have no doubt that
this condition was due partly to the smallness and great elasti-
city of the perineal belt, which would allow the weights to rest
on the floor, or the body to slip to the foot of the bed; partly to
the impossibility of adjusting weights to various degrees of
muscular strength and physical power; and partly to the inter-
ference of nurses and others, who, at the solicitation of the
patient, would remove the weights temporarily, thereby retarding
the efforts of nature towards reparation.
It was generally conceded that the principle involved in the
treatment of fractures of the thigh, proposed by Dr. Gurdon
Buck, was the same as that which I had advocated and practised
—namely, extension and counter-extension—and which many
surgeons at a meeting of the Medical Society of the State of New
York declared could never be successful.
Dr. Buck, therefore, in deference to the general opinion, added
a fanciful improvement for coaptation (the strips of split deal),
which was of no more use towards effecting the result desired
than would have been so much tissue paper encircling the thigh;
it served only to satisfy the patient and his friends.
I must, however, do him the justice to say that in the treat-
ment of gunshot fractures of the thigh, with loss of bony substance,
the weight and pulley serve an excellent purpose for extension;
but the weight should be so adjusted as to obviate the possibility
of its finding support on the floor, and thereby becoming use-
less. Instead, however, of using the perineal belt for the counter-
<pb>
extension in permanent treatment, we would advise the use of the
body only, as in a case described further on.
General Facts in the Surgical History of the Ambulance.
ROM the beginning of the siege to the 30th of November,
1870, above sixty wounded men were treated in the
ambulance.1 Of these but two died; and the immediate
cause of their death was tetanus. Four of the above number
were amputated through the thigh for wounds of the knee-joint;
two compound fractures—one through the neck and one through
the shaft of the femur—were successfully treated by conserva-
tion, and are now well, walking with crutches,2 and possessed
of good limbs; one compound fracture of the tibia, just below
the knee, recovered, but afterwards received an injury in another
part from which he died ;3 two gunshot fractures of the wrist
and two of the ankle-joint recovered with useful limbs; two
comminuted fractures of the scapula, a number of gunshot
fractures of the bones of the forearm, hands, feet, and fibula,
one resection of the shoulder-joint—for compound fracture of
the head of the humerus—in a soldier suffering from large
pleuritic effusion, one wound through the chest—ball passing
through the right lung, entering the third rib anteriorly, and
passing out posteriorly under the scapula—besides several other
serious cases, not particularly interesting in a surgical point of
view, were successfully treated.
We now come to a period extending from the 30th of No-
vember, 1870, to the end of the siege, in which food and fuel in

medical cases.

able to walk with only a cane. (J. S.) 3 See Case 8, p. 628.
<pb>
sufficient quantity or of proper quality were not to be had, so
that all the wounded whom we received, much exhausted from
exposure and want of food and fuel, were in a condition unfa-
vourable for surgical treatment. Many were suffering from the
usual camp diseases, such as diarrhoea, dysentery of a typhoid
character, and chills, and fever. Others had been lately dis-
charged from hospitals, where they had been under treatment
for the prevalent diseases bronchitis, pneumonia, and pleurisy,
and sent to field duty, and were therefore still very feeble. In-
digestion was the rule when food was taken ; while some were
unable to eat even when suitable food was offered. Subsequently
to this period the mortality was increased, owing to the causes
above enumerated, and to the mortal nature of the wounds.
For example, from seventeen shell wounds received from Drancy
in one day, eight died in a short time from their wounds. Still
later during the siege several died from acute pulmonary disease
superinduced by deficiency of fuel. Some of the deaths, as will
be seen by reference to the history of the fatal cases, occurred
immediately on or a few hours after arrival, while others whose
wounds were equally mortal shared the same fate at a later
period. It is therefore scarcely necessary for me to add that
the greatly increased mortality after the 1st of December was
due to causes over which surgery had no control.
It is proper to state in this connection that all our wounded
were brought to us directly from the battle-field, or had received
temporary surgical attention only, prior to their transportation
to the ambulance.
The gentlemen volunteer aids, whose duty it was to go to the
field with the carriages to pick up the wounded, made it a point
to seek and take in the most severely wounded, and particularly
those having fractures, as it was believed that this class of
wounded, especially, would suffer less under tents than in houses.
In thus selecting the severely wounded, many would of necessity
be brought in who were so gravely injured as to be amenable
only to palliative treatment. An additional reason for our
having obtained so large a number of this class of wounded,
was that these gentlemen were generally in advance of all others.
These facts explain why among the 247 surgical cases treated
<pb>
at the ambulance, there were 126 compound fractures.1 Notwith-
standing this great number of fractures and the causes previously
enumerated, only 47, or a little over 19 per cent., have died of
their wounds. The following table gives the number of fractures
classified according to the region involved.

Notwithstanding the large number of fractures, conservative
surgery was so extensively practised, that of the 126, only nine
seemed to require amputations of the long bones.
The results of these cases, as a whole, in spite of the adverse
conditions previously mentioned, will compare favourably with

fractures; a few soldiers had sustained two or even more, so as to represent 12G

<pb>
those of a similar class in other wars, though the latter class
may have been treated under much more auspicious circum-
stances.
Again, if we take into consideration the sixty cases received
prior to the 30th of November, and treated before the de-
pressing effects of the siege were felt, no results, either in
public or private practice, could have been more satisfactory;
for, with the exception of the accidental loss of two from
tetanus, there were no deaths.
Fractures of the Femur.
Only three gunshot fractures of the shaft or neck of the
thigh have been received in the ambulance suitable for con-
servative treatment; all the others have involved the knee-
joint. The above-mentioned were treated by extension and
counter-extension ; two, (Cases 3 and 4,) without the pulley; and
one, Case 134, with the pulley and weight alone. Case 3
was fractured in the neck of the femur, Case 4 in the middle,
and Case 134 at the juncture of the lower and middle thirds.
All recovered with comparatively little shortening and no
lateral distortion, as may be seen by reference to their histories,
which contain much matter of interest.
Case 3.—Corporal Jules Melchior, 2nd Company, 3rd Batta-
lion, 35th Regiment of the Line, was wounded September 30th,
1870. A ball entered on the inner side of the left thigh, about
one inch below the angle formed by the scrotum and the thigh,
fractured the neck of the femur, passed upwards, outwards, and
backwards, and had its exit through the gluteal muscles. On
arrival he was weak from great loss of blood. The limb, which
was greatly swollen, distorted, and shortened, was placed in a
wire gutter padded with oakum, and covered with hot-water
applications and oil-silk. It was then sufficiently extended and
fastened to the foot of the bed. This was effected by placing
strips of adhesive plaster on one side of the limb from the knee,
around the sole of the foot, and up to the knee on the opposite
side. These strips were held in place by bandaging the limb as
in Case 134 (see Fig. 54). A cord was then passed through the
loop of plaster on the sole of the foot, and fastened firmly to the
<pb>
foot of the bed or stretcher. Extension and counter-extension
were made by converting the bed into an inclined plane, by
raising the foot of the bed. Against this the body rested,
and thus effected the extension, sufficient to keep the limb and
body in a normal line without impeding the circulation or con-
fining the parts. The patient suffered no pain after the dress-
ings, and continued to improve, and also to eat and sleep well.
His only medicine was generous living. During the first twenty
days several small fragments were discharged from the posterior
wound; at the end of this time the anterior wound had closed,
and the limb was found to have shortened about three-fourths of
an inch. The limb continued to improve until November 10th,
forty-one days after the injury, when union seemed very strong.
November 20th, fifty-one days after the injury, there was groat
periosteal and interstitial thickening of the whole shaft of the
femur—so much so, as to give it the appearance of having been
fractured, with distortion. This was treated and reduced by the
tincture of iodine, hot-water applications and oil-silk. At this
time union seemed quite firm. Gradual improvement up to
January 20th, one hundred and twelve days after the injury,
when the patient was able to rise. Three days after, he began
to walk with crutches, and continued to do so for six days, with
no inconvenience on bearing the entire weight of his body on
the injured limb. However, upon careful examination it was
found that additional shortening had resulted. It was then
thought best to remand the patient to bed and apply extension
for several days. The periosteal thickening greatly diminished
—the limb had been otherwise in excellent condition, and the
patient was in enjoyment of perfect health. He was discharged
entirely well on the 1st of March, 1871. On this day photo-
graphs of his limb were taken, woodcuts from which are here
appended (Figs. 51, 52).
Cask 4.—Private Jules Hardy, 3rd Company, 2nd Battalion,
35th Regiment of the Line, was received September 30th, 1870.
His injury was a fracture of the middle third of the right fe-
mur, the central portion of the shaft being shattered through a
length of fully five inches. The ball entered posteriorly about the
middle of the shaft, was split into two fragments by the fractured
<pb>
bone, making two exits anteriorly. The patient on arrival was
much weakened from loss of blood. The limb was shortened
about five inches, and was distended to its utmost capacity by an
effusion of blood within the fascia lata. The limb was placed in
a gutter padded with oakum, and covered with hot-water appli-

cations and oil-silk, and extended and counter-extended, as in
Case No. 3, before described. During the whole course of the
treatment quinine and iron were given. October 20th, twenty
days after the injury, a fragment of bone, constituting the
entire thickness of the shaft, was removed. October 25th, a
second piece, similar to the former one, was removed during sup-
puration. The periosteal sides of both fragments were entirely
<pb>
smooth, showing that they had just been detached from the
periosteum, while the other presented a worm-eaten appearance.
The bone was found to be consolidated about November 10th.
November 17th, pretty firm union; no lateral distortion; fully
two inches shortening; no thickening except the fragmentary
consolidation. December 2nd, one of the anterior wounds closed.
December 15th, the posterior wound closed, but re-opened De-
cember 26th, at which time, upon careful examination, pieces of
dead bone were found firmly attached. January 15th, a small
abscess formed and was opened near the seat of the fracture.
January 20th, the limb was found to be firmly united, with about
two and a-half inches shortening. At this time extension was
taken off, and the whole limb and foot were bandaged to sustain
proper circulation. January 25th, gastric irritation set in with
severe vomiting; for three days the patient was unable to re-
tain anything on his stomach except champagne and ice. After
that attack his health returned, and he continued well up to the
5th of February, when there was more gastric irritation, but of
a milder form. Stimulants and milk were then administered
with success. February 10th, he was able to sit up for a few
hours a day. February 14th, he was able to bear, without incon-
venience, much weight on the injured limb. February 20th, his
face and body were somewhat uidematous; his urine was
examined and found loaded with albumen. Appropriate remedies
were given to combat the disease. There was steady progress
up to March 4th, the patient continuing to walk with crutches.
Urine still albuminous, but limb well and strong. On the 7th
there was very considerable oedema of the legs, giving to the
wounded limb the appearance of deformity. A photograph was
then taken of the patient, a woodcut from which is here ap-
pended (Fig. 53). On the following day the oedema had
disappeared, though the urine was still heavily loaded with
albumen, and he left for his home in the country, well, with the
exception of the diseased action of the kidneys.1

Case 134.—Private Zepherin Vautier, 2nd Company, 1st Bat-
talion, 7th Zouaves, was received November 30th, 1870; his
injuries were a fracture of the left femur, and a flesh wound of the
right thigh. A ball had entered through the rectus femoris, about
six inches above the knee-
joint, and passing through
the femur, had been divided
into three pieces, one making
its exit near the gluteal
muscle; another was ex-
tracted on the posterior
surface of the limb, nearly
opposite the point of en-
trance; a third remained
just under the skin, two
inches above the exit of the
last-named portion of ball.
The limb was shortened
about three inches, and
enormously swollen from
infiltration of blood in the
fascia. The patient suffered
little pain. His general con-
dition, to all appearances,
was good. The fractured
limb was placed in a wire
gutter or splint padded with
oakum, dressed, and the
extension made as in Case 3, except that the pulley and
weight were added, as shown in the accompanying sketch
(Fig. 54). The limb was examined from time to time,
and found doing well. January 4th, it was entirely re-
dressed; it was then found that all the wounds were healed
except at one point, where a splinter of the ball was being thrown
out by suppuration. The general condition of the. patient was
always good. One of the remarkable features in this case was,
that all the wounds, save the one in the gluteal region—from
this there was a small discharge of pus and fragments of bone—

<pb>
healed without any appreciable amount of suppuration. At this
time there was about one and a-quarter inches shortening of
the limb, some union, considerable bony enlargement, but no
lateral distortion. The limb continued to improve, and by the
middle of January the man was up. The evidences of fracture

were these:—1. That the limb would bend freely at the point of
fracture, notwithstanding the enormous swelling from the effusion
of blood. 2. That there were fragments of bone imbedded in the
pieces of ball. 3. That fragments of bone were discharged from
the wound in the gluteal region. 4. That there was, and is,
over an inch of shortening. 5. That the bone at the seat of the
fracture was and is much thickened. 6. That there was great
bony crepitation.

March 6th, this patient was discharged well, the fracture
firmly consolidated, although at that date he walked with
crutches. His appearance is shown in the accompanying
sketches from photographs taken at the time (Figs. 55, 56).
To show further what has been done in this direction, I call
attention to the report of the Surgeon-General of the United

"In examining the above table in detail, it is seen that the
results are ascertained in 822 of the 1,263 cases treated by
amputation, or 65 per cent.; in 64 of the 82 cases treated by
excision, or 78 per cent.; and in 1,117 of the 1,761 cases treated
by conservative measures, or 63 per cent." It further shows,
that of the 1,117 terminated cases treated by conservation, 71-26
per cent. died; while of the 822 terminated cases of amputation,
63-26 per cent. died; leaving 8 per cent. in favour of amputation.
It must not, however, be forgotten that there were 644 of the
former undetermined, while there were only 441 of the latter
under treatment.
I doubt not that the results of the unfinished cases will change
the balance-sheet in favour of conservative surgery.
The report further states, in way of explanation, "that the
amputations include most of the bad cases, and those in which
preservation of the limb was attempted and abandoned."
I do not fully understand what the "Circular" means by "bad
cases," unless it is that they are all wounds which destroy the
knee-joint, or so fracture the bone and lacerate the soft parts as
to require amputation. In such cases there is nothing to be
done but to amputate.
The writer of the above either forgets or fails to state that
in these cases amputation is generally performed upon the field
<pb>
and without much delay; they are therefore mainly good cases for
amputation.
The good results obtained under adverse circumstances in the
treatment of the class of gunshot fractures, above referred to,
and summed up in "Circular No. 6," convince me that the
difference in the percentage of recoveries between amputations
and conservations was due to the excessive inflammation occa-
sioned by insufficient protection of the fractured limb during
long and tedious transportations over bad roads, or no roads at
all, and by the delays and breaking of communication by steam-
boats and railway. Besides, the necessities of war, in some
instances, compel leaving the wounded on the field of battle for
days together. This was the case in the Seven Days' Battle of
the Peninsular campaign, in the Battle of the Wilderness, and in
many other instances. My opinion upon this subject is strength-
ened by reference to a report of the comparative results obtained
in the Crimean War between amputation and conservative treat-
ment. Professor Legouest there shows, that of 337 wounded,
having compound fractures of the thigh, and treated without
amputation, 117 recovered fit for service.
The fractures are thus divided as regards the seat of the
injury and the results :—

In this connection he shows that, of 1,666 amputations per-
formed, only 123, or 7-40 per cent., survived; while of the 337
cases treated conservatively, 117, or 35 per cent., survived. In
other words, the number of amputations of the thigh recovered,
as compared with that of the recoveries by conservation, shows
<pb>
that "there are four times as many recoveries" from the latter
treatment as from the former:—" That in fractures of the lower
part of the thigh, the number of recoveries from non-amputation
exceeds that from amputation. And, finally, that in fractures
located above the middle of the thigh, there are twenty-four non-
amputated cases surviving and not one amputation."
He then proceeds:—" To give the relative results obtained from
amputation and conservation in different parts of the shaft. For
the upper third of the femur, as 31-50 is to 6; for the middle
third of the femur, as 34-75 is to 6; for the lower third of the
femur, as 42 is to 10. The ratio of these tables is as 35 is to
7-40; that is to say, there is very nearly five times more chance
of recovery from a gunshot fracture of the thigh without ampu-
tation than there is with amputation."
In his concluding remarks on the conservation of the thigh he
states:—" That the practice of amputating the thigh, in conse-
quence of a gunshot fracture of the femur, which maintained its
supremacy so long without contestation, seems destined to-day
to give place to that of conservation of the limb."
Should it be argued that there must be other causes assigned
for the great disparity in the comparative number of deaths from
amputation and conservation in the Crimean War, I should
answer that the general statement is, that of the 1,664 amputa-
tions of the thigh performed in the French army, 1,541, or
92'60 per cent., died. But a more careful analysis shows that of
the 1,541 deaths
781, or 46-93 per cent., died in the Crimea;
278 ,, 16-70 „ „ „ at Constantinople;
482 „ 29'00 „ „ „ on their way to France.
1,541
Thus it appears that only 46-93 per cent. died before removal,
while 45-67 per cent., or about one-half, died en route, or in
hospitals far removed. Also, that amputations cannot be re-
moved, or even roughly handled at a very early period, with-
out a fearful mortality resulting therefrom. I have shown
conclusively, in a former part of this report, that compound
fractures of the thigh can be removed any distance without
<pb>
more encumbrance to ambulance trains than cases of recent am-
putations, and with greater safety, if we consider the results
obtained in the French army as a criterion.
Amputations of the Thigh.
There have been seven amputations of the thigh performed at
the American ambulance.
Of these, five were wounded through the knee-joint.
The sixth was wounded just below the knee-joint. From this
wound he had recovered, when he received an injury above the
knee, which necessitated amputation at the upper third. From
the effects of this second injury he died. The case is full of
interest, and is given under the head of " History of each case
which terminated fatally."—Case 8.
The seventh was wounded just below the knee-joint. An
india-rubber drainage tube was passed through the track of the
ball. Two days afterwards, however, it was found necessary to
amputate through the knee-joint, owing to great effusion in the
tissues below the joint, which destroyed their vitality. The
patient did well up to the twenty-fifth day, and was considered
out of danger, when, on account of a deficiency in fuel, he suffered
and died. (See Case 222.)
One of the above five cases, after he was considered out of
danger, died of tetanus. (See Case 7.)
A second on arrival was unable to retain food. He reported
that for several days preceding his wound he had suffered from
vomiting and other symptoms of gastric irritability. He was
wounded through the knee-joint, and the leg was completely in-
filtrated with blood and serum. Vitality had ceased, and ampu-
tation was performed without delay. But the patient failed
to retain anything on his stomach, and though he lost little or no
blood, either during the amputation or afterwards, he continued
to sink, and died two days after the operation.
The histories of the three remaining cases are as follows.
Case 5.—Private Alfred Doucet, 5th Company, 3rd Battalion,
35th Regiment of the Line, was received September 30th, 1870.
His injury was a fracture of the articulating portion of the
tibio-femoral end of the femur; the ball had entered poste-
<pb>
riorly, and lodged between the condyles, crushing that portion
of the femur into several pieces and opening the joint. Ampu-
tation was performed, by an anterior flap, at the lower portion
of the middle third of the thigh. The limb was dressed with
sutures, oakum, compresses and bandages, and covered with oil-
silk. Subsequently, adhesive plaster was applied in addition to

charge (No. 2), as also the appearance of the shoulder of Clement Daumont,

the above, to keep the edges of the wound in place. October 26th,
twenty-seven days after the injury, the patient was able to rise
and sit in his chair. Thirty-two days after the injury he was
able to walk with crutches. Fifty-live days after the operation
K R
<pb>
the wound was entirely healed. The limb has never since given
any trouble, and the patient has been in good health. March 1st,
the patient was discharged. At this date his photograph was
taken, a woodcut from which is given in Fig. 57 (No. 2).
Case 9.—Private Jean Buzier, 5th Company, 81st Regiment
 
No. 1. No. 2.

discharge; as also the appearance of the limb of Edmond Vernatier at the time

of the Line, was received September 30th, 1870. A ball had
entered just above the joint to the left of the middle of the
patella, and passed on, as far as could be discovered, externally
to, and not involving the joint; it was removed from the
<pb>
posterior aspect of the limb about the middle of the gastro-
cnemius muscle. On arrival, the patient was suffering severely
from loss of blood and violent spasms in the leg. These
spasms, due somewhat to the exertion of walking some distance
after the receipt of the injury, were prevented by splints applied
to the limb, so as to obviate any motion. The limb was then
covered with hot applications and oil-silk. Opiates were
given in moderate quantities to alleviate the pain. Soon
after the receipt of the injury, severe inflammatory action
ensued. Large abscesses formed beloAV and above the joint.
About the 26th of October, twenty-six days after the injury,
the joint was found to be diseased, and discharging large quan-
tities of pus and dead tissue through the openings of the
abscesses. From that time up to November 1st large and re-
peated doses of opium were required to keep the patient easy.
The condition of the joint showed that the cartilages were
severely inflamed. After a consultation on the 1st of November,
thirty-one days after admission, it was decided to amputate.
Amputation was performed by a long anterior flap. The joint
was found very extensively diseased ; the cartilages and several
portions of the articulating ends of the joint destroyed, the ball
having chipped off a portion of the articulating end of the tibia
in its passage downwards. After amputation, gradual improve-
ment followed, the wound healing kindly—much of it by first
intention. On the eighth day after amputation an undue disposi-
tion of the muscles to retract was counteracted by the weight
and pulley, applied by means of adhesive plaster around the
stump. At the end of thirteen days the patient was able to rise.
On the twenty-sixth day after the operation he was able to walk
with crutches, the wound being healed, except a space of one
and a-half inches, the site of an old abscess. The patient con-
tinued to do well up to January 15th, when he injured the
stump by a fall. An abscess formed in the neighbourhood of the
bone. February 14th, a small piece of carious bone was dis-
charged from the end of the shaft. Notwithstanding this the
patient was in perfect health. March 8th, a photograph was
taken, which is here reproduced (Fig. 58, No. 2).
Case 23.—Private Edmond Vernatier, 1st Company, 1st Bat-
<pb>
talion, 38th Regiment of Mobiles of the Seine and Marne, was
received from Bourget, October 21st, 1870. A ball had passed
laterally through the knee-joint, breaking the condyles of the
femur. The patient was in good health on arrival. Amputation
was performed on the 22nd of October, between the middle and
lower thirds of the femur, by a long anterior flap. The flaps
were brought together with sutures, the wound dressed with lint,
covered with oil-silk cloth and enveloped in oakum. On the
twelfth day the wound was nearly healed, and mostly by first
intention. On this day he had stiffness of the jaw, constriction
of the muscles about the throat, and all the symptoms of
approaching tetanus. The free use of cigarettes, containing
each four grains of opium, controlled these symptoms for a
time. At their reappearance the same treatment was followed.
They lasted during three days. On the sixteenth day the
ligatures came away. On the twenty-first day the patient was
able to sit up. Twenty-eight days after the operation he was
able to walk with crutches. He continued to improve, and was
discharged to the convalescent ward within thirty days after the
operation. January 20th, he was entirely well, and could go
anywhere on crutches.
March 8th, 1871, Vernaticr was discharged perfectly well,
and his photograph taken, which is here reproduced (Fig. 58,
No. 1).
Iti this connection it seems proper to call attention to the
comparative results obtained in our ambulance between ampu-
tation and conseiwation in gunshot fractures of the femur.
The percentage of deaths in amputations compared with the
results of conservations was as follows: seven amputations
of the thigh were folloA\red by four deaths and three recoveries,
or 42-8G per cent. Three gunshot fractures of the thigh
treated by conservation were folloAved by three recoveries, or
100 per cent.
A reference to the history of the four deaths after amputa-
tions of the thigh will shoAv, however, that in no case Avas the
amputation the immediate cause of the death, and that, more-
over, none of these cases could have been treated conservatively.
There Avas one resection of the knee-joint for compound
<pb>
fracture, which proved fatal. (See case 116, under the head of
"History of each case which terminated fatally.")
Resections, Amputations, and Conservations of the
Shoulder-joint.
There have been eight injuries to the shoulder-joint; of these
six occurred on November 30th, 1870. Primary excision was
performed in five cases, three of which recovered. Their histo-
ries are subjoined.
Case 32.—Private Clement Daumont, 5th Company, 2nd Bat-
talion, 35th Regiment of the Line (136th Marching Regiment),
was received from Malmaison, October 21st, 1870. A ball had
entered the left shoulder at the posterior border of the deltoid,
and had made its exit at the anterior border. The patient was
exhausted from loss of blood, and was, moreover, suffering from
gonorrhoea and pleurisy. The chest was filled with a pleuritic
effusion. The following day, October 22nd, excision was per-
formed by a longitudinal incision of about five inches through
the deltoid. The head and three inches of the shaft of the
humerus were excised. The wound was filled with lint, and
the parts covered with w^arm water applications and oil-silk.
This treatment was continued until the fifth day, when suppu-
ration commenced. The patient was supported by stimulants.
Improvement was regular. The arm was supported from the
neck and shoulders by diachylon and bandages until the 25th of
November, when he was transferred to the convalescent hospital.
Two small abscesses afterwards formed, but in no way interfered
with the success of the operation. In the middle of January
he was able to use his hand in the manufacture of baskets. Early
in March he was quite well, and had good use of his hand and
arm, wrorking daily at his trade. At this time his photographs
were taken, sketches from which are here appended. (See Fig.
57, No. 1, and Fig. 59.)
Case 56.—Lieutenant Fenelon Barbier, 3rd Company, 1st
Battalion, 114th Regiment of the Line, was received November
<pb>
30th, 1870. A ball had entered at the anterior face of the left
humerus, and had passed directly backward through the head of the
bone, making its exit posteriorly. December 2nd, excision was
performed by extending the opening longitudinally and ver-
tically, and removing the head of the bone by sawing through
the surgical neck. The long
tendon of the biceps was pre-
served. The wound was filled
with lint, and the parts were
covered with warm water ap-
plications and oil-silk. De-
cember 4th, healthy suppura-
tion was established. On the
tenth day, after excision, a
drainage tube was inserted
into the wound, and the edges
brought together by strips of
diachylon. The arm was sup-
ported by means of bands.
December 21st, nineteen days
after the operation, the wound
was nearly closed. January
25th, the wound still closing
and the shoulder resuming its
normal condition. February
25th, the patient was entirely

Case 166.—Private Alphonse Tessier, 5th Company, 2nd Bat-
talion, 112th Regime nt of the Line, was received from the outposts
at Bourget, December 24th, 1870. A ball had entered anteriorly
to the shoulder-joint, and had passed through the head of the
humerus, making its exit posteriorly. The head was crushed to
atoms, many of which were carried out posteriorly, and remained
in the deltoid. He was intoxicated on arrival. The skin around
the entrance was burnt, the wound having been received from a

He arrived late in the evening.
Excision was
<pb>
performed immediately by lamplight. The posterior wound was
extended in the long axis of the limb, and the head and about
one inch of the shaft of the humerus removed. During the first
twenty-four hours the parts were much swollen. Warm linseed
poultices were used. For the first three days the wound was
filled with lint, covered with compresses dipped in warm water,

and enveloped in oil-silk cloth. After the fifth day, when pus
began to form, the wound was dressed with nitric acid lotion.
The inflammation at this time had begun to diminish. Up to
the twenty-first day the patient did well; then fuel giving out,
he suffered from the severe cold, and had a slight chill. The gra-
nulations disappeared, and his appetite became poor. On the
twenty-third day he was somewhat better, and healthy pus was
<pb>
again secreted in abundance, but exhaustive suppuration con-
tinued up to the twenty-fifth day, when the edges of the wound
were brought together with adhesive plaster. On the twenty-
seventh day he suffered from vomiting and diarrhoea, which
were controlled in part by
laudanum and brandy. The
same day delirium super-
vened. Beef—horse beef—
tea and brandy were given
every hour. The quantity
of pus decreased, and the
granulations diminished. On
the forty-first day the wound
again opened, and discharged
freely. The following day
his diarrhoea was entirely
controlled, and he began to
improve. The day after he
sat up, though vomiting again
occurred in the course of the
day. From this time he con-
tinued steadily to improve
until February 21st, when
the wound was nearly closed,
and his health so far re-
established that he could sit
up all day without fatigue.
March 3rd, he walked about
and was considered as per-
fectly well. March 12th,

The two remaining cases did well up to the nineteenth day,
and were considered out of danger, but they died from the effects
of cold, caused by a deficiency of fuel. (Cases 96 and 109,
'"History of Fatal Cases")
Besides these, there were three other cases reserved for conser-
vative treatment. They all did badly for days after admission,
and it was found that unless amputation or excision were per-

<pb>
formed they would die. The most favourable case was selected
and excision performed; but, as was feared, it only hastened the
fatal result. The patient died soon after the operation. (History
of Fatal Cases, Case 83.) The two remaining cases were compli-
cated. (History of Fatal Cases, Cases 59 and 120.)
There were no amputations at the shoulder-joint, and but one
of the arm; the history of this case, No. 106, is given at length in
another connection.
In the report of the Surgeon-General of the United States'
the subject of shoulder-joint operations is carefully discussed,
with the records of 1,033 cases which had been treated up to
a certain date during the Rebellion.
The Report states:2—"It is creditable to the surgery of the
war that the number of cases of amputation at the shoulder-joint
reported is less than the number of cases of excision of the head
of the humerus, and that the latter operation appears to have
been adopted in nearly all the cases in which it was admissible.
The reported cases of amputation at the shoulder-joint for the
entire period numbered 458; of excisions of the head of the
humerus there were 575. Of the 237 terminated cases of
amputation, 93 died, a ratio of mortality of 39'2, which is 6-7
per cent, greater than the mortality in excisions."
And again:3—"Excisions of the Shoulder-joint.—Nearly all
the cases that have been reported during the war have been
recorded. The results are given in the following table:—

"The percentage of mortality is 23-8 in primary cases, 38-59
in secondary cases, or a mean ratio of 32-48. The ratio in
amputations at the shoulder-joint is 39-24, a percentage of 6-76
in favour of excision. Of 36 cases of gunshot fracture of the
head of the humerus, selected as favourable cases for the expec-
tant plan, and treated without excision or amputation, 16 died, or
44-4 per cent., a ratio in favour of excision of 11-96 per cent.
But it is superfluous to offer further proofs in behalf of this
admirable operation."
It is scarcely necessary to say, in view of these results,
that excision is the proper treatment for gunshot fractures of
the shoulder-joint, and that amputation is only admissible when
the soft parts are so injured as to destroy vitality or render the
arm useless.
Fractures of the Tibia and Fibula.
Of this class of injuries I append two cases, to show the results
of the treatment.
Case 36.—Corporal Anatole Menez, 5th Company, 3rd Bat-
talion, 3rd Regiment of Zouaves, was received from Malmaison,
October 21st, 1870. A ball had fractured the shaft of the right
fibula, in the upper third. Warm water applications covered
with oil-silk cloth were used until the sixth day, when warm
linseed-meal poultices were substituted to accelerate suppu-
ration and combat the pain produced by the formation of ab-
scesses. The pain continued intense until several small scales of
bone were discharged. A drainage tube was inserted after the
tenth day, and opium cigarettes of four grains each were freely
given to calm the pain. From this time the case proceeded
favourably until the date of discharge, December 8th; the
patient then returned to service perfectly well.
Case 244.—Corporal Hippolyte Charpenet, 9th Regiment of
Chasseurs, was received January 24th, 1871. He was thrown
from his horse, which fell upon him and produced a transverse
fracture of the middle third of the tibia and fibula of the right
leg. When the patient was received, the limb was much
swollen from inflammation and infiltration in the tissues. The
limb was placed in a wire gutter, well padded with oakum, so as
<pb>
to keep the bones in place. It was then covered with hot water
applications and oil-silk, which were changed as often as the
comfort of the patient would indicate. The limb continued to im-
prove up to the 1st of March, when it was found to be firmly
united, with no distortion. On the 6th of March the patient
was discharged entirely well.
Fractures of the Arm.
There were eight gun-shot fractures of the forearm. Of
these seven recovered; one died. The history of this case
(No. 106) will be found under another heading.
Case 130.—Private Pierre Lheandre, 3rd Company, 3rd Bat-
talion, 114th Regiment of the Line, was received with two
wounds, from Champigny, November 30th, 1870. A conoidal
musket-ball had entered at the anterior face of the ulna, frac-
turing the bone, and had passed out through it posteriorly,
making a wound of three and a-half inches in length by two
and a-half in breadth at entrance, and a large one at exit. A
fragment of shell had struck the inner part of the left thigh, pro-
ducing a flesh-wound extending from the inner condyle of the
femur, 5 in. upwards and inwards. No apparatus was applied.
The treatment was limited to warm water applications, covered
with oil-silk cloth. The progress was very favourable. No
untoward symptoms arose to retard recovery. January 6th,
both wounds were healed, and the fracture firmly consolidated.
Case 225.—Private Joseph Paya, 1st Company, 2nd Battalion,
109th Regiment of the Line, was received from Montretout,
January 19th, 1871. A ball had entered the forearm a little above
the carpal end of the ulna, breaking it at this point, and had
passed obliquely upwards and outwards, making its exit pos-
teriorly. There was paralysis of the little and ring fingers, caused
by the destruction of the ulnar nerve. The parts were covered
with compresses dipped in warm water and enveloped in oil-silk
cloth, and the hand was supported by a splint. This treatment
was continued for six days, when pus began to form freely;
nitric acid lotion was used in addition as a stimulant. Several
abscesses formed in the tendons of the anterior and internal
muscles, which afterwards discharged through the wounds. On
<pb>
the thirty-first day after admission an abscess formed and was
opened in the middle of the anterior part of the forearm.
March 3rd, the wound was_ healed; there was a little stiffening,
but no anchylosis in the wrist-joint; the patient was discharged
well.
Case 31.—Private Jean Louis Pelletier, 6th Company, 1st
Battalion, 38th Regiment of Mobiles of the Seine and Maine,
was wounded at Malmaison, October 21st, 1870. A ball had
entered the right forearm posteriorly, and passed obliquely
downwards, fracturing the shaft of the ulna at the lower third.
Warm water applications wrapped in oil-silk were used. On the
sixth day, when suppuration commenced, warm flaxseed poul-
tices were substituted. An artificial support was given to the
arm by light wooden splints, retained by strips of adhesive
plaster. Progress was continuous, and he was discharged on the
19th of December, perfectly well.
Case 18.—Private Flouriselle Lecomte, 1st Company, 1st
Battalion, 38th Regiment of Mobiles of the Seine and Marne,
was received from Malmaison, October 21st, 1870. A ball had
entered the right forearm, anterior to and a little above the carpal
end of the radius, and had passed downwards between the carpus
and the carpal end of the ulna, fracturing both. The arm and
hand were supported by a splint extending from the elbow to
the ends of the fingers, and fixed immovably by bands of adhe-
sive plaster. The parts were kept moist by wet compresses
covered with oil-silk. Fomentations were added when abscesses
were forming or scales of bone were seeking an outlet. The
healing of the wound was continuous, and the patient was dis-
charged, December 19th, with a useful hand-—having regained
also the partial use of the wrist.
Case 115.—Private Leon Filip, 1st Company, 3rd Battalion,
42nd Regiment of the Line, was received November 30th, 1870.
A bullet had entered the inner side of the forearm, about 4 in. below
the elbow, and had passed out just below the olecranon, breaking
the same and opening the joint. The elbow was not swollen,
and it was therefore determined to treat the case without opera-
tion. The wounds were dressed with compresses dipped in
warm water, and covered with oil-silk. Suppuration began on
<pb>
the seventh day, up to which time he had suffered no pain. On
the 8th of December he had a chill, due probably to the forming
of an abscess. On the same and following day there was great
pain and slight swelling of the joint. Cold dressings, with
laudanum, were now applied, and gave much relief. On the
twelfth day he had slight constriction in the throat, which was
relieved by cigarettes containing each four grains of opium. On
the fourteenth day two or three little spicula e of bone were
discharged from the superior wound. The forearm and hand
now began to swell considerably; there was a very free discharge
of pus, and pain had entirely ceased. On the thirty-fifth day
abscesses began to form in the upper third of the forearm. On
the 12th of January, forty-three days after admission, a piece
of the olecranon, about one-fourth of a cubic inch, was dis-
charged. At the above date he had eight or ten abscesses in the
upper third of the forearm. February 21st, the forearm was
much less swollen, and the abscesses had begun to heal. The
great number of small abscesses was probably due to the fact
that he would not permit the first large abscess to be opened,
and not to the presence of necrosed bone, as might have been
supposed. There was much thickening about the elbow-joint,
impeding the motion of the arm, but no bony anchylosis.
March 11th, some pain and inflammation. March 12th, there was
found to be some necrosis of the superior end of the ulna, which
might require time to dispose of. The patient was discharged
March 18th, quite out of danger, and with every prospect of
having a useful limb.1
Case 14.—Private Dieudonne Boussinesy, 6th Company, 2nd
Battalion, 45th Regiment of Mobiles of Herault, was received
October 17th, 1870. His injury was a fracture of the middle of the
ulna—caused by a ball from a revolver—with an anterior and ln-
terior wound. The parts were covered with hot water applications
and oil-silk. The arm was supported by splints and bandages.
After twenty days, perfect union had taken place, and the splints
were removed. At this time there was great bony thickening,

joint. (J. S.)
<pb>
giving to the :irm the appearance of distortion. By November
25th all the debris of bone had been discharged, the anterior
wound, however, not being quite healed. There was steady im-
provement up to December 10th, when the patient was discharged
well.
Fractures of the Tarsus and Ankxe-Joint.
I introduce the two following cases to show the mode of treat-
ment and the general results in this class of wounds.
Case 41.—Private Louis Godon, 5th Company, 3rd Battalion,
3rd Regiment of Zouaves, was received from Malmaison, October
21st, 1870. A ball had entered the sole of the foot, passing through
the os calcis and astragalus, and making its exit anterior to the
ankle-joint. For the first week the whole foot and limb were
enveloped in compresses dipped in warm water and covered with
oil-silk cloth. On the sixth day pus formed in such quantities that
a drainage tube was passed through the wounds in the foot. From
time to time debris of bone were removed. Several abscesses
formed and were opened. Towards the end of February he
appeared to be quite well. There remained however a little
stiffness about the joint, but no bony anchylosis. He was not
yet able to bear the weight of his body on his foot. March 25th
the patient was discharged much improved.1
Case 45.—Private Michel Gaudry, 4th Company, 28th Regi-
ment of the Line (36th Marching Regiment), was received
October 22nd, 1870. He had several wounds. A ball had
entered the right foot anteriorly to the external malleolus,
and passed obliquely upwards, backwards, and inwards be-
tween this and the astragalus, cutting in its course the
tendon Achillis. A second ball had passed through the left
axilla, making in its course five flesh wounds. A third ball had
passed through the second joint of the phalanx of the index
finger of the right hand, crushing the joint. The patient was
found in a small house in the outskirts of Rueil, where he had
dragged himself the night after the battle. He was much ex-
hausted from loss of blood, want of food, and exposure. His
1 July 1st.—Patient well, and has full use of his limb. (J. S.)
<pb>
nervous system was much affected, and for several days it was
necessary to force him to take sufficient nourishment. He had
several violent chills. Stimulants were freely given. Suppura-
tion having commenced on the fifth day, the foot was rendered
immovable by wooden splints and adhesive plaster, and dressed
with compresses dipped in warm water and covered with oil-silk.
Linseed-meal was used when abscesses were forming. Several
of these formed on the inside and outside, and were opened. A
drainage tube was passed through the joint. December 15th, the
wooden splints were replaced by a pillow, which, when wrapped
around the leg and secured by bandages, served the same pur-
pose—viz., gave support. He continued to improve, and with
the exception of an occasional abscess, his convalescence was
steady.
At the end of February, there was a slight stiffness about the
joint, but no anchylosis. The wound in the finger was dressed
with warm water applications, and the finger made firm by
bands of adhesive plaster. It is now healed, but shortened and
anchylosed.
Fractures of the Scapula.
The following are two interesting" cases of this class of
Injuries:—
Case 43.—Captain Martin Ducos, 6th Company, 3rd Battalion,
3rd Regiment of Zouaves, was received October 21st, 1870. A
ball had entered posteriorly to the middle portion of the clavicle,
and passed obliquely downwards through the spine of the scapula.
The wound was covered with warm water applications, poultices,
and oil-silk. Scales of bone continued to be discharged from
time to time up to the 20th December, when both wounds were
healed. The patient was only confined to his bed for fifteen
days. February 15th he was discharged well, with the exception
of a little stiffness in the muscles surrounding the joint. Opium
was given in small doses to combat the pain. He was well
sustained by a generous stimulating diet.
Case 6.—Barnole Gill, 2nd Company, 3rd Battalion, 35th
Regiment of the Line, wa s admitted September 30th, suffering
from a fracture of the scapula. A ball had entered just behind
<pb>
the middle of the clavicle, and passed downwards and back-
wards through the middle of the scapula, fracturing the same,
and making its exit at the apex.
The parts were covered with warm water compresses and oil-
silk cloths. On the 6th day after admission there was a free
discharge of pus. On the 9th, fragments of cloth and debris of
bone accompanied the ordinary discharge. The above treatment
was continued to the 25th of October, at which date the anterior
wound had closed. Morsels of bone still frequently issued from
this injury until November 25th. December 15th, the posterior
wound had closed. December 10th, patient was discharged well.
Fractures of the Carpus.
Of this class of injuries all recovered. I give the details of
two cases, to show the mode of treatment adopted and the good
results obtained therefrom. In case 215, the entire carpus was
carried away, the wrist shortened about an inch, and still a good
and useful limb resulted.
Case 191.—Private George Goudelin, 6th Company, 3rd Bat-
talion, 109th Regiment of the Line, was received from Buzenval,
January 19th, 1871. A ball had entered the right hand at the
centre of the carpus, on the idnar side, making an opening of
half an inch, and had passed obliquely downwards, carrying
with it the greater part of the carpus, and having its exit just
above the junction of the metacarpal bones of the thumb and
forefinger, cutting the radial artery and palmar arch, and making
an exit wound of three inches in diameter. He arrived at the
ambulance much exhausted from loss of blood. His wound had
a mushroom appearance. The haemorrhage was with difficulty
controlled during the first four days. It recurred repeatedly,
and was as often checked by cold astringents, compresses, and
bandages. On the 26th suppiiration commenced, and several
small pieces of bone were removed. A support of thin board,
cushioned with oakum, was attached to the hand and fore-
arm. The dressings consisted of compresses dipped in warm
water and enveloped in oil-silk. This treatment was continued
until February 5th, when linseed poultices were used to alleviate
the pain caused by the forming of an abscess. Suppuration
<pb>
continued abundant. February 13th, a second large abscess began
to form between the two wounds. To relieve the excessive
pain and nervousness, laudanum was freely added to the poul-
tices. From this time to February 20th, the suppuration was
profuse, but the swelling of the parts had subsided, and the
patient's general condition improved.
March 8th, the patient was discharged with a useful limb.
Case 29.—Private Charles Joseph Engel, 5th Company, 2nd
Battalion, 36th Regiment of March, was received from Mal-
maison, October 21st, 1870. A ball had entered the left hand at
the lower face of the carpus, anterior to the carpal end of
the ulna, fracturing the carpus, and making its exit posterior
to the carpal end of the phalanx of the index finger. On arrival
the patient was anaemic. There was considerable haemorrhage
from the wounds, and also from the nose. He was at this
time suffering from rheumatism. The hand and forearm were
covered with warm water applications and oil-silk. Suppu-
ration began on the fifth day, when poultices of linseed-meal
were substituted. Several slight haemorrhages were treated
with burnt alum. Stimulating drinks were freely given. The
arm and hand were placed on a large, soft pillow. During the
interval between this time and November 15th several abscesses
formed at different points over the carpus, and discharged freely
both pus and bony debris. The hand and forearm were sup-
ported by splints padded with oakum and sustained by bands
of diachylon. The progress was continuous, and November
25th the patient was transferred to the convalescent ward.
February 25th, the wound was entirely healed, and the patient
had recovered, in a great measure, the use of his wrist.
March 4th, the patient was discharged well, with a useful hand
and arm.
Fractures of the Maxillaries.
There have been five gunshot wounds of the jaws. All
recovered, and as they contain much of interest I give their his-
tories.
Case 62.—Captain Pierre Jardin, 1st Company, 3rd Battalion,
42nd Regiment of the Line, was received November 30th, 1870.
s s
<pb>
A ball had entered the left side of the face, one inch anterior to the
angle of the left jaw, and had passed out immediately under the
right ramus, destroying in its course the lower maxillary on the left
side and the muscles of the tongue, and cutting into the fauces.
He was weak from loss of blood, but otherwise in good con-
dition. Being unable to take food, owing to the opening in the
fauces, he was fed by the stomach-pump. On the 5th of Decem-
ber haemorrhage occurred, which was arrested by liquid perchlo-
ride of iron. In the night it re-occurred. December 6th, six
days after the injury, there was again haemorrhage. It was
arrested by laying open all the tissues between the wounds of
exit and of entrance, removing all the debris of bone and tissue,
and ligaturing the sub-lingual artery, which had been wounded.
The facial artery was compressed by passing a silver wire
through the tissue under the artery, and twisting the two free
ends over a block of wood with a compress under it. The
wound was then left exposed to the air until all haemorrhage
had ceased and the wound was dry. It was then treated by hot
compresses and oil-silk. December 10th, four days after, the
wire compression was removed, and suppuration fully esta-
blished. In addition to the warm compresses, dilute nitric acid,
120 drops to the quart of water, was applied to the wound.
This treatment was continued up to the 25th of January, when
the wound was nearly closed. The patient was discharged
February 15th, entirely well.1
Case 65.—Captain Louis Noell, 1st Company, 3rd Battalion,
114th Regiment of the Line, was received from Champigny,
November 30th, 1870. A ball had entered the face on the right
side, about one inch outwards and downwards below the outer
angle of the mouth, and had passed obliquely downwards and
outwards, breaking the ramus of the inferior maxillary between
the condyle and the inferior angle; re-entering just above the
inner angle of the scapula, it passed out again through the lower
angle, fracturing the same. The treatment consisted in the appli-
cation of compresses dipped in warm water. The upper and lower
jaws were fastened together with metallic wire by means of the
1 July 28th.—The patient is in good health.—J. S.
<pb>
teeth, the upper jaw acting as a splint to the lower. On the tenth
day after admission a very small piece of bone was discharged
from the lower wound of the scapula. Pieces of bone were also
discharged from the jaw. An abscess formed in the neck and was
opened. He was discharged on the 19 th of February, well,
except that a slight amount of suppuration continued from the
scapula, evidently from some small fragments of bone not yet
exfoliated. At this time the jaw had nearly resumed its normal
position.
Case 73.—Corporal Pierre Soulan, 3rd Company, 3rd Battalion,
114th Regiment of the Line, was received from Champigny,
November 30th, 1870. A ball had entered below the malar bone
on the right side, and had passed internally to the ramus of the
jaw, and out through the middle of the neck; re-entering just
above the scapula, it passed downwards through the spine of that
bone. It was extracted at the ambulance on the same day. The
parts were covered with warm water dressings enveloped in oil-silk.
On the 5th of December, suppuration having commenced, warm
fomentations were applied. The discharge of pus was at all
times abundant and healthy. Small abscesses formed at different
times from the 10th of December to the 3rd of January, anterior
and posterior to the scapula along the line of the wound. Sup-
puration continued until the 10th of January. From this time
until January 20th he convalesced rapidly, and was thought
ready to be discharged. He was retained, however, until Febru-
ary 19th, awaiting an opportunity to return home.
Case 129.—Private Rene- Le Viement, 3rd Company, 3rd
Battalion, 42nd Regiment of the Line, was wounded at Cham-
pigny, November 30th, 1870. A musket-ball had entered midway
between the ramus of the jaw and the symphysis on the left
side, and had passed obliquely forwards, frightfully crushing the
jaw and dividing it into four portions, one at each angle, and
one on each side of the symphysis. The whole front of the lower
jaw and lip was torn into fragments. A cheiloplastic operation
was performed. The lower lip was cut through and the splinters
removed; the partially detached fragments were put back into po-
sition. The loosened teeth were left in—those alone which were
forced from their alveoli being removed—and tied to the sound
<pb>
teeth 'with silver wire. A simple apparatus, ordinary bandages,
maintained the parts in place, fixed the chin and fine of the
teeth, and steadied the fragments. From the great comminu-
tion and splintering of the bone, followed a copious and fetid
muco-purulent discharge. The fetid secretion was a source of
great discomfort to the patient, by finding its way to the
stomach. Scrupulous attention was paid to cleanliness by
repeated injections of a solution of carbolic acid. The consti-
tutional irritation was overcome by the administration of the
hydrate of chloral and opiates. Moderate antiphlogistic regimen
was employed, and the patient disturbed as little as possible.
During a period of four weeks he was not allowed to masticate,
but was sustained by fluid nourishment. Talking was likewise
prohibited. Union took place slowly, and the fragments con-
tinued mobile for several weeks. January 6th, 1871, the wires
were removed, and an apparatus of gutta-percha, having been
soaked in warm water, was moulded to the part while soft; as
soon as it had assumed the proper shape it was dipped in cold
water and allowed to dry; its interior was lined with lint, and
thus properly padded it was fixed in place by bandages. This
apparatus, however, did not hold the parts in as close and
accurate apposition as the more simple means employed at first.
By the fourth week after admission the fracture had assumed a
certain degree of firmness, enough to keep the fragments in
apposition; it still, however, yielded at the points of injury.
February 19th, 1871, the patient left the ambulance for his home.
The teeth had contracted adhesions, and fixed themselves firmly.
The jaw was solid, but the articulation somewhat impaired,
although the face presented no appearance of deformity.
Case 145.—Private Joseph Sebastian Chabrier, 4th Company,
2nd Battalion, 35th Regiment of the Line, was received from
Champigny, December 2nd, 1870. A ball entered above the
right malar bone, one and a-half inches from the angle of the
eye, passed downwards and backwards in a line with the lower
lobe of the ear, and had its exit 3 in. posterior to the ear, cutting
in its course the facial nerve and producing paralysis of the left
side of the face; re-entering one and a-half inches below in the
neck, it passed down the muscles of the back, posterior to the
<pb>
spine, as far as the middle of the dorsal region. It was extracted
at the ambulance. The treatment consisted in the application of
compresses dipped in warm water and covered with oil-silk cloth.
On the fourth day, when suppuration commenced, hot poultices
were substituted. Abscesses formed from time to time, and
discharged by the wounds and by the ear. This treatment was
continued up to February 21st, when suppuration was still going
on in the ear. The wounds of the neck and back closed soon
after the injury. February 27th, he sat up and walked about.
March 7th, he was discharged in good health, although paralysis
still continued, and the ear discharged slightly.
Case 179.—Francois Koux, Sapper, 1st Company, 2nd Regi-
ment of Engineers, was received from Buzenval, January 19th,
1871. A ball had entered the inferior maxillary to the left of the
epiphysis, fracturing the lower part of the alveolus, carrying
away several teeth on the left side, and lodging in the base of the
tongue. The wounds were filled with lint and enveloped in
warm water applications covered with oil-silk. When suppura-
tion began warm poultices were used. Roux was discharged
well, February 7th, 1871.
Case 200.—Private Louis Hippolyte Cintrat, 3rd Company,
116th Battalion, 16th Regiment of National Guards, was received
from Buzenval, January 19th, 1871. A ball had entered the face
midway between the symphysis and the angle of the right lower
jaw, fracturing the inferior maxillary, and had passed obliquely
backwards, not displacing the teeth. Warm water applications
were used, and when suppuration began, warm poultices covered
with oil-silk were substituted. Progress was rapid and con-
tinuous, and on the 16th of February the patient was dis-
charged, the wounds being healed, and the displacement of
the jaw very slight.
Wounds of the Abdomen.
There have been several wounds of the abdominal and pelvic
cavity. One of these recovered. An abstract of the case is sub-
joined. The histories of the fatal cases will be found under
another heading. In the case, the report of which is here
<pb>
appended, the direction taken by the ball would indicate a
wound of the liver.
Case 239.—Private Alphonse Barbier, 5th Company, 10th
Battalion, Mobiles of the Seine, was wounded January 19th,
1871, by a rifle ball, which entered the right hypochondriac
region at the junction of the anterior and inferior extremity
of the ninth rib, passed obliquely across, and made its exit
posteriorly, just above the crest of the ilium at the juncture
of the eleventh and twelfth ribs near the spine. He was
received in a very feeble state; great abdominal pain, ten-
derness on pressure, and symptoms of traumatic peritonitis,
but no extra-abdominal extravasation. The entire body, from
the armpits to the hips, was enveloped in warm water applica-
tions, covered with oil-silk. Opium was administered in full
doses. January 31st, the pain on pressure was circumscribed.
February 2nd, there was no abdominal pain or tenderness.
February 27th, the patient's wounds were healed, and he was
discharged perfectly well.
Penetrating Wounds of the Chest.
These have not been very numerous, but on account of the
interest attached to them I append the histories of the four which
terminated in recovery. Careful histories of the three which
terminated fatally will be found in another section of this report.
In two of these cases the wounded survived their injuries but a
few hours.
Case 13.—Private Jean Mondine, 5th Company, 4th Battalion,
100th Regiment of the Line (14th Marching Regiment), was re-
ceived October 13th, 1870. A ball had entered just below the
external end of the clavicle, crushed the third rib, passed down
through the right lung below the inferior border of the apex of
the scapula, crushing the seventh rib in its exit, and had lodged
under the skin, from whence it was extracted on the same day.
The patient was very weak from loss of blood, and had great diffi-
culty of breathing. The wound was covered with silk plaster so
as to constitute an elastic valve, permitting the egress of air and
fluid, but not the ingress of either. The chest was supported firmly
by bandages. The pain was combated by opium and chloral, and
<pb>
the system sustained by a liberal use of stimulants, generous
food, and quinine wine. The pleural cavity was filled with blood.
The posterior wound closed at the expiration of ten days. The
anterior wound continued to discharge pus and blood for about
twenty days, when auscultation and percussion showed the cavity
of the chest to be emptied of all fluid matter. November 10th
the patient was able to rise. From that time he continued to
improve, and was discharged December 19th entirely well.
Case 55.—Captain Eugene Roche, 3rd Company, 2nd Battalion,
42nd Regiment of the Line, was received November 30th, 1870.
A ball had entered and fractured the eighth and ninth ribs on
the left side, on a line vertically under the axilla, opening the
pleura, and producing intense suffering and great difficulty of
breathing, followed by constitutional disturbance. He was na-
turally of a delicate constitution, and was greatly weakened by
loss of blood. The ball, with several fragments of bone, was ex-
tracted at the ambulance on the evening of arrival. Some
haemorrhage followed the operation. The wound was covered
with silk plaster to prevent the ingress of air and to allow the
exit of fluid. Great local inflammation followed, which was
treated with warm water compresses and oil-silk. Pain was
combated by opiates. At the expiration of eight days full and
healthy suppuration was established. Fifteen days after the in-
jury an abscess formed, and was opened. For several days hot
applications were applied. December 18th, eighteen days after
the injury, nitric acid lotions and bandages were used in addition.
The case then proceeded favourably, and the patient was dis-
charged January 20th, entirely well.
Case 64.—Lieutenant Louis Choley, 3rd Company, 3rd Bat-
talion, 42nd Regiment of the Line, was received from Champigny,
November 30th, 1870. A bullet had entered anteriorly between
the sixth and seventh ribs, and had passed directly backwards
through the right lung and out through the rib, fracturing the same.
There had been but little haemorrhage from the wounds. He
discharged blood with his sputa, and had considerable difficulty
in breathing. His chest was covered with compresses dipped in
warm water, enveloped in oil-silk cloth, and tightly bandaged.
Suppuration was fully established about the sixth day. From
<pb>
that period the wounds were stimulated with nitric acid lotion.
January 13th, 1871, they were healed. Two days afterwards he
was discharged cured.
Case 68.—Captain Jean-Baptiste Alliey, 5th Company, 3rd
Battalion, 114th Regiment of the Line, was received November
30th, 1870. A ball had entered between the third and fourth ribs
on a line below the middle of the clavicle, and had passed down-
wards and backwards through the right lung, and out of the chest
through the apex of the scapula. He had, -when admitted, a
severe cough, was suffering from great difficulty of breathing, and
expectorated large quantities of blood. There was a troublesome
bleeding from the anterior wound. These conditions lasted up
to the 13th of December, twelve days after the injury, when
pus mixed with blood was discharged from the anterior wound.
The conditions remained the same until January 1st, when he
began to improve. On the 19th the anterior wound was entirely
healed, the posterior wound being still open and discharging
healthy pus. Upon percussion it was ascertained that there was
considerable thickening of the lung tissue, and that effusion had
taken place within the cavity of the pleura, producing much pain
and dulness. The chest was painted with the tincture of iodine
from December 13th to January 25th, forty-three days, when it
resumed its normal condition. The remaining wound healed
soon after, and on the 19th of February he was discharged in
perfect health. Besides the application of iodine, the chest was
bandaged so as to prevent pain and the disposition to haemorrhage
from the movement of the respiratory muscles. To prevent the
introduction of air into the chest through the openings, the
wounds were covered with isinglass plaster. This acted as a
valve, allowing the egress of air and fluid matter, but not the
ingress of either. Pain and extreme nervousness were combated
by the use of morphia, chloral, and the valerianate of zinc. The
patient was sustained by liberal nourishment, iron and quinine.
'Wounds of the Nerves.
I give the two following cases as illustrative of the general
condition following this class of injuries. In one case there can
be no doubt that the sciatic nerve was wounded.
<pb>
Case 108.—Private Pierre Bretenaud, 6th Company, 2nd Bat-
talion, 124th Regiment of the Line, was received from Champigny,
November 30th, 1870. A ball had penetrated the left thigh,
passing posteriorly to the femur, about four inches above the
knee-joint, in the line of the sciatic nerve. On arrival there was
entire loss of motion and sensation below the knee-joint, except
in the anterior part of the leg and around the heel. There was
great pain in the foot and ankle-joint. This was combated with
warm compresses saturated with laudanum. The wounds healed
rapidly. On the thirty-first day raised blisters filled with blood
were perceived on the upper surfaces of the four small toes of the
left foot. The cuticle was removed and the toes dressed with
nitric acid lotion. Subsequently the great toe became affected
in the same manner, and was similarly treated. On the thirty-
eighth day after admission it was found that sensibility had re-
turned to the skin of the foot. Pain in the foot returned at in-
tervals of a few days, but was much diminished in degree.
February 3rd, the sixty-sixth day, all but the fourth toe were
entirely healed, and that was nearly so. The paralyzed condition
of the muscles of the leg remained. The patient was discharged
February 19th, cured of his wounds, and directed to use the limb
as much as possible.
Case 128.—Sergeant Laurent Arraquin, 2nd Company, 3rd
Battalion, 35th Regiment of the Line, was admitted November
30th, 1870. He was wounded in the right thigh. The ball had
entered on the inner side of the rectus muscle, about the middle
of the thigh, and had passed downwards and backwards, and out,
just above the popliteal space, at a point near the sciatic nerve.
For some time his condition improved. Warm water applications,
covered by oil-silk, constituted the dressing. December 18th, a
slight inflammation supervened near the wound. December
20th, it had increased, the excessive tenderness of the parts was
greater, and the secretions had become unhealthy. The inflamed
parts were bathed in a liniment of chloroform, sweet oil and
laudanum, and the wounds covered with linseed poultices. Lau-
danum and chloral were given internally. December 21st, he
was attacked with general spasms, which returned at intervals
until the 23rd, when the inflammation began to diminish, the
<pb>
spasms to subside, and the secretion of healthy pus was restored.
January 21st, his wounds were healed. He walked with
crutches until February 28th, when he was discharged well.
 
History of each Surgical Case which terminated fatally
while under treatment at the american ambulance.
||ASE 7.—Private Ernest Grevin, of the 35th Regiment of
the Line, was wounded the 30th of September, 1870. He
was suffering, when brought to the ambulance, from a
gunshot fracture of the condyles of the right femur, the
missile having destroyed the knee-joint in its course through
the limb. October 1st, amputation was performed at the junc-
tion of the lower and middle thirds. Circular flaps were
made. To the 9th of the month the progress of the patient was
good. On that day he was attacked with tetanus. Opium in large
doses was administered frequently during the day. This failing
to relieve him, chloral (hydrate) was added—5 grammes dis-
solved in 250 grammes of syrup; the solution was given in
tablespoon doses every hour; this produced considerable pro-
stration, but little relaxation or decrease of rigidity or spasm. The
dose of chloral was then increased to 15 or 20 grammes in
twenty-four hours, but even this failed to afford any apparent
relief. About the 11th of October the patient was taken with
severe spasms, which continued to increase until the following
day, the 12th of October, when he died.
Case 8.—Private Joseph Edet, 5th Company, 2nd Battalion,
35th Regiment of the Line, was wounded September 30th,
1870. A ball had passed through the epiphysis and femoral
end of the tibia, destroying nearly two inches of the bone
below the joint, but not opening the joint. The wound was
covered with hot water applications, enveloped in covered
oil-silk cloths, and the limb placed in a wire gutter. After
<pb>
twenty days a great quantity of bony debris was removed. At
the end of thirty days more was removed, at which time several
abscesses formed and were opened, on each side below the
injury. At the end of fifty-five days the joint was in good con-
dition, the wound suppurating freely; a large amount of bony
matter was being deposited, and the bone becoming firmly united.
Until the seventy-second day the limb improved and the general
condition of the patient was good. Edet was now directed to get
up. He continued to improve for seven days, when, whilst sitting
with his leg extended on a second chair, a nurse fell heavily
upon the unsupported portion of the limb. Great swelling and
inflammation followed, immediately after the accident, extending
from the knee to the hip. Enormous abscesses formed under
the quadriceps muscle and around the femur, extending from
the middle of the femur to the knee, and appearing to involve the
joint. On Tuesday, the 27th of December, a puncture was
made, with Dieulafoy's apparatus, on the inner face of the
tendon of the quadriceps muscle, about an inch above the
patella. One and one-half fluid ounces of pus were removed;
two days afterward two fluid ounces were removed; two days
after this three and a-half fluid ounces; on the 3rd of Janu-
ary fourteen fluid ounces. On the 6th twelve fluid ounces were
removed from a corresponding point exterior to the quadriceps.
Finding that such large quantities of pus were constantly form-
ing, and that a small opening existed at the seat of the first
puncture, through which pus was constantly flowing, it was
thought advisable to insert an india-rubber drainage tube,
through which large quantities of pus (not less than sixteen
fluid ounces) continued to flow daily. The limb was then placed
in a wire gutter, at such an angle as would be most useful for
locomotion in case of a stiff' limb. During all this time the leg
remained in its former healthy condition, except the swelling
incidental to interrupted circulation of blood, and dependent upon
inflammation and swelling of the thigh. A collection of pus,
seemingly independent of the other, now formed externally to
the tendon of the quadriceps muscle. An opening was made
about an inch above the patella (externally), and a drainage tube
introduced, through which several ounces of pus were immedi-
<pb>
ately discharged, and through which large quantities of pus con-
tinued to flow daily. The inner abscess continued to extend
upwards on the inner face of the thigh, and subsequently broke
six inches above the first opening. From this time large quan-
tities of fluid and blood were discharged daily from these open-
ings. At this time, January 25th, one hundred and seventeen days
from the first injury, and thirty-nine days from the second, the
thigh had diminished in size, so as to be smaller than the healthy
one. On the 28th of January a consultation was held, and it
was decided to amputate, as the last chance for recovery. From
the receipt of the first injury up to the time of amputation, the
pus was always healthy. When the amputation was performed,
over a quart of pus and clotted blood was discharged, coming
from around the femur and the soft parts of the thigh as high
up as the upper third. The condition of the soft parts and the
denuded state of the bone rendered it therefore necessary to
amputate through the upper third of the femur. The destruc-
tion of muscular and soft tissue on the anterior part of the thigh
rendered it impossible to obtain a flap from that source. It was
deemed best to make a long flap from the posterior part of the
limb. The amputation was therefore performed after the method
of Teale, except that the long flap was taken posteriorly instead
of anteriorly. In order to avoid the mischief which might arise
from involving the nerve in the cicatrice, the main trunk of the
sciatic nerve was removed from the posterior flap. Not more
than two or three ounces of blood were lost in the operation.
The limb was dressed with sutures, bandages and supports.
Full reaction soon took place. The patient was seemingly doing
well. There was complete union by first intention through the
whole extent of the limb, except at the points left for drainage
and at a small slough, of the size of a five-franc piece, over the
seat of the old abscesses, to which was applied dilute nitric acid
as a stimulant. The slough was entirely discharged at the end
of six days, leaving a healthy granulating surface, with secretion
of healthy pus. Notwithstanding this the patient died on the 5th of
February, evidently exhausted by the repeated drain from the
system incident to the long-continued processes of suppuration.
Examination of the amputated limb showed that the knee-joint,
<pb>
as well as the entire leg and foot, were in a healthy state ; that
the portion of the tibia involved in the comminuted fracture
had discharged all the debris of bone ; that the cavity was so
nearly filled up with a new deposit of bony tissue, as to render
it as strong as the other limb ; and that the abscesses, instead of
involving the joint, had destroyed many muscles and their con-
nections with the femur, and had extended from near the knee-
joint to a distance of eight inches above, producing the condition
of the bone previously described. It is thus evident that, so far
as the results of the treatment of the fracture were concerned,
it was all that could have been desired; and that the cause of
the fatal result was due entirely to the second injury, and its
effects upon the involved parts which, prior to the accident, were
entirely healthy.
Case 10.—Private Henri Tribouillard, of the 35th Regiment
of the Line, was wounded on the 30th of September, 1870. A
ball entering the left thigh, externally, opposite the junction
of the lower and middle third of the femur, had passed obliquely
upward and inward posterior to the femur, making its exit
posteriorly twelve inches above the knee (not involving the
artery, nerve, or bone), and had again entered the heel of the
right foot just below the internal malleolus. These wounds
continued to do well up to the 6th of October, when the thigh
wound had healed. The heel injury still remained open.
Toward night, on the 6th, without any warning symptoms or
apparent cause, the patient was attacked with tetanus. Large
doses of laudanum were hourly administered, but with little
effect. On the succeeding day, the patient not improving, a
large dose of chloral was given every two hours, while during
the intervals the potion of opium was increased. He was seized
with spasms soon after, which continued to exhaust him
gradually until the 10th of October, when he died.
Case 53.—Lieutenant-Colonel Adrien Prevault, of the 42nd
Regiment of the Line, was wounded at Champigny, November
30th, 1870. The ball entered two inches externally to the ensi-
form cartilage, passed obliquely backward through the abdominal
cavity, and made its exit posteriorly, wounding the spine. When
admitted he was much exhausted from shock, haemorrhage.
<pb>
and intense pain. Palliative treatment was adopted. The
patient vomited profusely, had frequent chills, with a feeble
circulation, and died ten hours after admission.
Case 54.—Commander Rhodolphe Mowat, of the 114th Regi-
ment of the Line, was wounded at Champigny, November 30th,
1870. A ball had entered and passed through the lower part of
the right lung. On admission he was much exhausted from loss
of blood, and greatly depressed in spirits. He sank into a state
of great irritability; his mind wandered continually, and on the
2nd of December, thirty hours after admission, he expired. In
consequence of there being no post-mortem examination, it was
doubtful whether or not the projectile had entered the abdomen.
Case 58.—Captain Alexander Bourson, 2nd Company, 3rd
Battalion, 42nd Regiment of the Line, was wounded November
30th, 1870. A ball had passed through the fleshy part of the
arm, just above the elbow joint anterior to the humerus. Another
ball had entered the left gluteal region, making its exit pos-
teriorly through the middle part of the thigh. The patient was
prostrated by habitual intemperance, by bad food, and from
great exposure to cold. The wounds were covered with warm-
water applications and oil-silk. The case proceeded favourably
for ten days, when profuse secondary haemorrhage occurred.
This was arrested by compression and astringents for six hours,
when it again occurred, but was arrested by increased com-
pression and astringents. Eighteen hours afterward, there was
again haemorrhage. The wound in the arm was then extended
in the line of the artery upwards and downwards, and the artery
tied on both sides of the opening. The wound did well for five
days, when haemorrhage again occurred from the cardiac side of
the humeral artery. The artery was again exposed some two
inches above in the healthy tissue, and again ligatured. From
this time there was no more haemorrhage. The great loss of
blood, added to the bad condition on arrival, produced an ex-
tremely feeble circulation. Prior to the last operation the patient's
health had declined, his appetite had become very poor, and his
general circulation feeble; so much so, that it was deemed
advisable not to amputate. Three days afterwards abscesses
formed in the arm. These were opened, and discharged healthy
<pb>
pus freely. As these abscesses extended lower down, other
openings were made. Circulation became more and more
feeble; and the patient, not having retained any nourishment for
several days, sank and died December 25th.
Case 59.—Lieutenant Joseph Cheon, 5th Company, 3rd Battalion,
42nd Regiment of the Line, was wounded November 30th, 1870. A
ball had entered the right shoulder anterior to the glenoid cavity,
passed thence through the shoulder, and made its exit posteriorly,
injuring the head of the humerus so slightly, that it was con-
sidered advisable to preserve the joint. The patient was of a
scrofulous temperament, and had suffered much from cold, as
also from insufficient and bad food. The wound was covered
with warm water applications and oil-silk cloth. Moderate in-
flammation ensued. On the ninth day the suppuration was free,
with discharge of fragments of bone. The patient remained for
the following eight days without any improvement, gaining no
strength from the little food and stimulants he was able to
take. A passive secondary haemorrhage occurred about this
time, evidently from the capillary vessels. He grew weaker
daily until the 10th of January, when he died. All this time
the pus remained healthy, except when mixed with blood, when it
became offensive. Post-mortem revealed the fact that the head
of the humerus was carious, and entirely deprived of its covering.
Case 63.—Senior Captain Hippolyte Proal, 2nd Battalion,
35th Regiment of the Line, was wounded at Champigny, Novem-
ber 30th, 1870. A ball had fractured the condyles of the femur
and destroyed the knee-joint. On arrival it was found that he
was suffering from gastric irritation, had vomited on eating for a
week prior to his being wounded, was emaciated, and had lost
a large quantity of blood on the battle-field. Blood was also
effused within the fascia lata, distending the skin to its fullest
capacity. Circulation had entirely ceased below the knee, and
his vomiting continued. Amputation was performed the morn-
ing after admission by a long anterior flap. The loss of blood
from the operation did not exceed three ounces. He rallied soon
afterwards, and for some hours improved, evidently from the re-
moval of the source of irritation. During the second and third
day he continued very nervous, with feeble circulation and no
<pb>
appetite, the vomiting continuing. Diarrhoea now intervened,
and on the third day retention of urine was superadded; this
was relieved by the catheter. He died, however, the same even-
ing from the exhaustion induced by the causes above enumerated.
Case 72.—Private Jacques Viallard, of the 42nd Regiment,
was wounded at Champigny, November 30th, 1870. One ball
had entered the left pectoral one inch external to the nipple, passed
across the chest, fractured the rib and crushed the sternum,
making its exit by the right pectoral, one and a-half inches
beyond the nipple, and opening the pleural cavity. A second ball
had entered the right arm near the elbow, fractured the ulna,
opened the elbow-joint, and lodged near the coronoid process,
from which it was extracted at the ambulance. Still a third
ball had entered the body near the posterior portion of the crest of
the ilium, crushing the crest and the transverse processes of the
lumbar vertebrae, and then lodged deep in the muscles. On
admission he was much exhausted from haemorrhage and from
the oft-mentioned causes incident to the siege. The injured
parts were covered with warm water applications and oil-silk
cloths. Subsequently linseed-meal poultices were substituted;
the arm was properly supported, and stimulants were freely
administered. December 10th, the wounds discharged a large
amount of offensive matter. This rapidly weakening him, he
sank, and died on the 11th.
Case 82.—Private Francois Moinet, of the 14th Regiment of
Artillery, was wounded at Champigny, November 30th, 1870.
The left hip was struck by a fragment of shell, which crushed
the ilium, destroyed the gluteal muscles and periosteum over a
space of four square inches, and exposed the peritoneum. Owing
to the shock, improper food, and loss of blood, he was very
faint and much exhausted on arrival. The wounds were at first
dressed with warm water applications, and subsequently stimulated
with dilute nitric acid; extensive sloughing of the soft parts
followed, but no healthy suppuration or granulation; a large
portion of the ilium became necrosed soon after the injury; the
patient grew delirious, and gradually sank until the 13 th of De-
cember, when death ensued.
Case 83.—Private Martin Knittel, of 119th Regiment, was
<pb>
wounded at Champigny, November 30th, 1870. A ball had entered
the deltoid at the junction of the middle and upper thirds of
the left humerus, and had passed diagonally upward and inward,
fracturing the head of the humerus in its course. The arm
and shoulder were so much swollen as to prevent the immediate
discovery of the ball. The case was diagnosed as a compound
fracture of the shaft of the humerus very close to the head of
the bone, and was regarded as one suitable for conservative
treatment. Little motion was perceived at the point of fracture
upon any movement of the arm. The wound never granulated,
but discharged unhealthy matter; the parts became more
swollen; and the patient's condition growing worse, a more
careful exploration of the parts disclosed the fact that the joint
was involved, when it was deemed advisable to resect it, in order
to afford the only means of recovery. Prior to the operation,
while the subject was under the influence of chloroform, it was
found that the missile had passed into and along through the
medullary cavity, splitting the bone into fragments above the
insertion of the deltoid, and had lodged in the glenoid cavity of
the scapula. The operation was followed by moderate re-action;
still great exhaustion remained. Stimulants failed to produce
the desired effect. From the first, the stomach was unable to
receive and digest food, but after the operation the appetite
improved, and the patient responded more readily to stimulants.
The wound was cleansed and stimulated with a solution of carbolic
acid, and dressed with lint dipped in nitric acid lotion. On
the 15th the patient's condition was worse; he seemed more
exhausted and more disposed to sink; same treatment con-
tinued. In the evening the wound was re-dressed, and he
appeared better. December 16th, Knittel had passed a quiet
night, and seemed to be rallying under the influence of stimu-
lants until near evening, when he suddenly began to sink, and
died during the night.
Case 85.—Private Francois Theoli, of the 6th Regiment of
Artillery, was wounded at Champigny, November 30th, 1870.
The ball had entered the left leg at the inner side of the middle
third, passed diagonally downward and forward, fractured the
tibia, and lodged close to it without entering the bone. The
T T
<pb>
result was a fracture without comminution. The ball was ex-
tracted on the evening of the day of admittance. The patient
was exhausted from loss of blood, from cold, sickness, and want
of food. His circulation was feeble. He stated that he had
been under treatment in a hospital for syphilis, and that he had
more recently been discharged from a hospital for diarrhoea. On
the day of arrival he complained of pains in the head, back,
and in the loins; while at times there was mental aberration.
December 2nd, rheumatic inflammation having ensued, the body,
from the leg to the arm, was covered with warm water com-
presses and oil-silk cloths, and the adjoining painful parts
painted with the tincture of iodine. The injured limb was
placed in a wire gutter well padded with oakum, and linseed-
meal poultices were substituted for warm water dressings.
December 8th, an abscess formed three inches above the wound,
and was opened and allowed to discharge freely. December
12th, a second abscess formed, and was opened below the frac-
ture. The patient at this period being unable to sleep, from
fifty to seventy-five drops of laudanum were administered every
night. December 20th, there was severe diarrhoea accompanied
by colic. Opium and bismuth pills were given for this, but
without much effect. December 21st, a casual visitor acciden-
tally fell against and displaced the gutter, violently shaking the
wounded limb, and producing a haemorrhage which, though
temporarily checked by burnt alum, perchloride of iron, &c., fre-
quently re-occurred during the three following days. December
23rd, diarrhoea again became very troublesome. We had re-
course now to the mistura cretce and large doses of laudanum
(given alternately every two hours, both day and night). De-
cember 24th, circulation feeble; diarrhoea continues. Stimulants
used, and tannic acid added to the doses of yesterday. Passages
now consisted of a dark green bilious matter. December 26th,
injections of starch and laudanum temporarily arrested the
diarrhoea. December 28th, syphilitic nodes appeared, accom-
panied by great pain, swelling, and tension behind the ears.
Attacks of diarrhoea re-occurred, followed shortly by delirium.
December 29th, constant evacuations both of faeces and urine.
Chloral given hourly. Patient died about 3'30 a.m. the follow-
<pb>
ing day. The suppuration from the wounds and incisions was
at all times abundant and healthy. Diarrhoea was undoubtedly
the immediate cause of death, accelerated by his previous condi-
tion and the character of his injury.
Case 96.—Private Jean-Baptiste Buisson, of the 116th Regi-
ment, was wounded at Champigny, November 30th, 1870. A
ball had entered near the humeral insertion of the left pecto-
ralis major, producing a comminuted fracture of the head and a
portion of the shaft of the left humerus. A piece of the ball also
lodged and was embedded in the glenoid cavity, the remainder,
as was subsequently discovered, entering the cavity of the chest.
The patient was faint from loss of blood, and suffering from in-
sufficient food and from exposure to the cold, which was at that
time intense. December 2nd, excision was performed by a longi-
tudinal incision in the deltoid, removing the head of the humerus
and a portion of the shaft, which was comminuted. On the fifth
day the wound was beginning to granulate, and was suppurating
fully. On the sixth, the wound appearing indolent, was covered
with lint dipped in nitric acid (sixty drops to a pint of water),
and this was again covered with warm water compresses and
oil-silk cloth. From this date healthy pus continued to be
secreted. December 13th, a caoutchouc drainage tube was
inserted, and the wound was gradually closed by strips of ad-
hesive plaster. The patient sat up daily and continued to
improve until December 21st, when he was considered conva-
lescent. At this time the supply of coal gave out, and it was im-
possible to renew it before the expiration of twenty-four hours.
The cold was. then intense, and the patient, together with others
in the same tent, suffered severely. He also began to complain
of pains in the loins, of great difficulty in respiration, of loss of
appetite, followed by severe vomitings and a distressing cough.
December 22nd, he was taken with a chill. During several days
the bad symptoms continued to increase, though the discharge
of pus was healthy until the 25th, when it became watery. The
patient continued to sink, and died on the 27th, twenty-five days
after the operation.
Case 105.—Private Felix Castet, of the 114th Regiment of the
Line, was wounded at Champigny, November 30th, 1870. The
<pb>
ball entering the middle of the right gluteus, had passed directly
into, and was lodged in, the pelvis. The patient was a man of strong
constitution, and apparently healthy. From the date of admission
to the date of the formation of an abscess, the practice of drawing
off his urine twice a day was uninterrupted. Up to the 10th of
December the progress of the wound was as good as could be
expected. On that day pus was found to have been secreted in
the rectum. December 14th, being constipated, his bowels were
relieved by an enema. An enormous quantity of pus was dis-
charged from the wound. An abscess was found to be forming
also in the perineum. Notwithstanding these depressing in-
fluences patient continued cheerful. During the night of the 14th
about two quarts of blood issued from the wound. After this
he became very weak and irritable. December 16th, another
haemorrhage. About a quart of blood lost. December 17th, a
third haemorrhage, followed by death. A post-mortem showed
that the ball had passed through the ischium, across the pelvis,
and had lodged on the left side of the rectum, where it was
found embedded in the soft parts. An enormous abscess had
formed in the pelvis, breaking into the rectum and perineum, and
carrying with it also fragments of bone.
Case 106. — Private Pierre Lambolez, 2nd Company, 3rd
Battalion, 42nd Regiment of the Line, was wounded at Champigny,
November 30th, 1870. The ball had entered the right fore-
arm posteriorly, three inches below the elbow-joint, producing a
fracture of the radius and ulna, and had passed out anteriorly
lower down the forearm. On admission to the ambulance the
patient was in a typhoid state; previous exposure, want of
nourishment, and haemorrhage had completely exhausted him,
and what little strength remained availed little, owing to his
habits of intemperance, which had left his stomach in such a
condition as to be unable to respond to food or to alcoholic stimu-
lants. Great swelling followed, owing to infiltration of blood
and serum in the tissues, and to such an extent that loss of
vitality of the parts was threatened. Extensive incisions were
then made to relieve the tension of the parts, which served, how-
ever, to afford only temporary relief. The vitality of the arm
continued to decrease until December 7th, when amputation
<pb>
at the upper third of the arm was performed. The alleviation
was manifest. The patient's appetite, which prior to this opera-
tion had been poor, now became much better. He also partook
freely of cognac and wine, while before he had refused any drink but
vinegar. Notwithstanding this apparent improvement the typhoid
condition grew upon him day by day, the stump assumed an
unhealthy gangrenous appearance, and he continued to sink
until the 18th of December, when he died.
Case 109.—Francois Renaudie, 114th Regiment of the Line,
was wounded at Champigny, November 30th, 1870. The ball
entered the left arm near the pectoralis major—one inch below
the acromion process, and fracturing the head of the humerus,
made its exit through the superior parts of the deltoid, a little
below the spine of the scapula. December 3rd, the head of
the humerus, with about one and a-half inches of the shaft,
was removed. The longitudinal incision was employed, and
the long head of the biceps was consequently preserved. The
warm water and oil-silk applications, which were at first em-
ployed, were in a short time accompanied by dilute nitric acid
lotions. December 7th, the surface of the incision had granulated,
and was apparently secreting an abundance of healthy pus. The
edges were brought together as far as possible by strips of
adhesive plaster. The condition of the patient and of the wound
continued good until the 21st of December, when the appetite of
the patient began to fail, and the little that he partook of to distress
him. December 23rd, the discharge became less creamy; appetite
failed entirely. December 26th, patient became sick at the
stomach, and vomited matter of a bilious nature. December 27th,
the surface of the wound seemed less healthy, and was accordingly
stimulated with the solution of sulphate of copper alternately
with dilute nitric acid. December 28th, patient's indisposition
so far decreased that there was an evident improvement both in
the appetite and in the appearance of the wound. December
29th and 30th, he sat up for a short time. December 31st, the
former symptoms returned with severity, while he became hourly
weaker, until the following day, January 1st, life gradually and
painfully ebbed away. From the day of the receival of the
injury to the day of his death there had been no period,—save
<pb>
indeed that period above mentioned,—when the injured parts did
not discharge an abundance of healthy matter. The post-mortem
showed that a little bony reparation had ensued, but no abnormal
conditions were observed.
Case 116.—Private Louis Rancy, 2nd Company, 1st Battalion,
113th Regiment of the Line, was wounded at Champigny,
November 30th, 1870. A ball had passed through the middle
of the patella, thence through the knee-joint, passing out just
above the inner tuberosity of the femur, and crushing the same.
From the moderate amount of injury done it was deemed a good
case for resection. The knee was resected on the 3rd of
December, the femur being removed just above the condyles,
and the patella being enucleated from the under surface of the
flap. A drainage tube was also passed laterally through the
knee. The operation was performed by an anterior circular
flap, and the wound reclosed by silk sutures. The limb was
then placed in an iron-wire gutter well padded with oakum. The
first dressings consisted of oakum and compresses wrapped around
the limb, the whole being enveloped in oil-silk. More than half
of the wound united by first intention. On the sixth day some
inflammation supervened, which was combated by warm
water applications. This treatment was continued till the 14th
of December, eleven days after the operation, when pus was
found burrowing in the muscles of the thigh. On the 15th of
December he had slight rigors, then attributed to the con-
siderable formation of pus. After its removal a re-accumulation
was prevented by heavy compresses and bandages. On the
thirteenth day after the operation his appetite failed and slight
fever supervened. The wound, however, continued to look well,
and secreted healthy pus. Up to the nineteenth day his con-
dition remained about the same, and although the pus was not
quite as laudable, the wound always maintained its healthy
character. He then had a slight secondary haemorrhage, and
died soon after. A post-mortem examination showed the head
of the tibia covered with good granulations, and one-fourth of
the cut end of the femur denuded of its periosteum, presenting a
nearly white appearance, from incipient necrosis. The residue
of the femur exposed was not only healthy, but had thrown out
a large quantity of healthy granulations.
<pb>
Case 117.—Private Jean-Paul Baizand, 35th Regiment of
the Line, was wounded at Champigny, November 30th, 1870.
A splinter of shell had entered the left lumbar region, and
had passed obliquely upwards into the cavity of the chest,
wounding in its passage the abdominal viscera, fracturing the
ribs and spine, and lodging under the skin. He had lost blood
largely on the field and during transportation. On admission
at the ambulance he was dying from excessive haemorrhage; he
expired two hours after his arrival.
Case 120.—Private Laurent Villiet, 3rd Company, 3rd
Battalion of the 123rd Regiment of the Line, was wounded at
Champigny, November 30th, 1870. A ball had entered the
right side of the neck, and gliding on under the skin, had its
exit about two inches from its entrance, making only a flesh wound.
A second ball entering posteriorly just above the right shoulder,
passed through the spine of the scapula, and out, eight inches
below the same shoulder, in the back. A third ball penetrated
the right shoulder, injured and opened the joint without crushing
the humerus, sped down between the skin and the bony tissue,
and had its exit just above the crest of the ilium. The wounds
were immediately covered with warm water applications en-
veloped in oil-silk cloths. At the expiration of five days pus had
formed freely. In about thirty days several of the wounds had
healed, but those immediately connected with the joint and
scapula still remained open. The pus becoming thin and offen-
sive, much similar to What would be discharged from a necrosed
bone, and the wounds showing no disposition to cicatrize, the
parts were stimulated by the officinal solution of nitric acid.
About this time the patient began to suffer from headaches,
thirst, stiffness and soreness of all his limbs, rigidity of the jaw,
and fever. These conditions continued until two days prior to
his death, when he was taken with chills induced by deficiency
of fuel. From this moment he gradually sank, and on the 25th
expired. The autopsy revealed the fact that there was necrosis
of the head of the humerus and of the spine of the scapula.
Case 122.—Private Jean-Baptiste Granger, 2nd Company,
2nd Battalion, 42nd Regiment, was wounded at Champigny,
November 30th, 1870. On admission he was in an extremely
exhausted condition from loss of blood, exposure, and difficulty
<pb>
of breathing. A ball had passed through the neck, wounding
the pharynx and the larynx, causing great swelling of the
parts, general emphysema, and much difficulty in respiration.
A second ball had entered the middle of the right arm, fracturing
the shaft of the humerus, and making its exit posteriorly. The
arm was properly supported in a wire gutter; the wounds were
dressed with warm water applications enveloped in oil-silk.
Great effusion, inflammation, and profuse suppuration ensued,
succeeded by considerable necrosis of the broken ends of the
shaft. On the 5th, breathing better, the effused air had mostly
disappeared; but a distressing cough had set in. The air still
continued to pass out and in at the openings in the neck during
expiration, inspiration, and during the efforts to cough. On the
6th, swelling decreased, cough worse, and an abscess formed
above the elbow; this was opened, and discharged freely. From
this time until the 10th patient improved, though his cough was
constantly troublesome; on that day several spiculae of hard
bone were removed from the arm; the suppuration was abun-
dant. It was now found that both ends of the broken bone
were necrosed. The patient continued, however, to eat and sleep
well; his wounds discharged freely, and his breathing was good—
except from an occasional disposition of the glottis to spasm—
until the afternoon of the 17th, when the pus began to decrease,
and the breathing to suffer from oedema of the glottis. He was
placed in a steam-bath room, and his respiration was greatly re-
lieved by twelve o'clock of the same night. On the 17th respira-
tion better. Continued improving up to the 18th, when he became
delirious—tearing off his dressings. On the 19th cough nearly
gone—breathing better. On the 20th tore off bandages and
bed-clothes during the night—pulse 130. Condition remained
about the same, with good breathing, until the 23rd, when an
abscess formed in the arm, and was opened. On the 24th,
appetite failing, refused food, breathing good, pulse feeble.
During the night, fever, delirium, and high pulse. On the
following day delirium increased, breathing unobstructed. Died
on the 26th at 1 o'clock.
Case 126.—Private Victor Manne, 1st Company, 2nd Regi-
ment of Engineers, was wounded at Champigny, November 30th,
<pb>
1870. A large fragment of shell had passed through the spine
and abdomen. He was insensible on arrival, and continued so
up to the moment of his death, which occurred twenty-four
hours after admission.
Case 127.—Private Charles Maurice Arnaud, of the 125th
Regiment of the Line, was wounded at Champigny, November
30th, 1870. A rifle ball had struck the left side of the skull
obliquely, causing a depressed fracture of the left parietal bone,
near its articulation with the occipital. Owing to the impossi-
bility of removing the pieces of the inner table, which were
depressed and rested heavily on the membranes of the brain,
the skull was trephined, and the depressed portions elevated.
During the operation the patient was nearly insensible. He
rapidly, however, regained his consciousness, but never the
complete use of his mental faculties. Cold water dressings were
applied for four days, when there were no further signs of
cerebral disturbance. On the fifth he had a severe chill, severe
pains in the head,, and nervous twitchings, accompanied by vomit-
ing. Drowsiness and stupor set in, followed by partial paralysis
of the left side. He was never afterwards fully rational. On the
sixth he became delirious. On the seventh he was seized with
convulsions. These continued until the next day, December
8th, when coma succeeded, and he died. No autopsy.
Case 131,—Private Emil Bruno Saiibe, of the 106th Regi-
ment of the (German) Line, was wounded at Champigny,
November 30th, 1870. The ball had entered about an inch
below the middle of the spine of the ilium, and passed thence
into the pelvis. On admission he had paralysis of the left leg,
complete retention of urine, and great constipation. The wounds
were dressed with warm water applications and with oil-silk
coverings. The retention of urine was relieved twice a day by
the use of the catheter. This treatment was continued until the
discharge of foetid matter compelled the use of oakum and
carbolic acid to absorb and disinfect the secretions. Constipation
was relieved by enemas. The condition of the patient continued
with little variation until December 14th, when severe inflam-
matory fever intervened, succeeded by diarrhoea, neuralgic pains,
and increasing inability to sleep. Large doses of chloral and opium
<pb>
failed to produce any relief. There was but little change in
these symptoms up to December 19th, at which date he died. A
post-mortem examination revealed the fact that the ball had
passed obliquely downward and backward into the pelvis, thence
through the psoas magnus and iliacus internus muscles, and had
entered the sacrum, lodging in the sacrum externally to the right
ilium, just at the right ilio-sacral junction. In its course the
ball had destroyed a portion of the cauda equina, thus explaining
the cause of the paralysis above-mentioned.
Case 132.—Private Michel Hulard, 2nd Company, 3rd Bat-
talion, 4th Regiment of Zouaves, was wounded at Champigny,
November 30th, 1870. He lay nearly twenty hours on the field
of battle. He was received at the Ambulance December 1st,
with a fracture of the occipital and the two parietal bones.
The missile had removed the superior angle of the occipital and
dura mater beneath, and literally comminuted and carried away the
whole top of the skull, including a large portion of the brain.
On admission the brain substance protruded and was oozing out;
but notwithstanding the loss of nearly half of the cerebral
substance, he lived on until the 5th, taking food, though wholly
unconscious, when convulsions supervened, followed by death,
five days after the injury.
Case 133.—Private Guillaume Paule, of the 123rd Sharp-
shooters, was received from Champigny, November 30th, 1870.
He was mortally wounded through the spine, shoulder, and
lungs, and died thirty hours after arrival.
Case 135.—Private Gustav Seining, a Saxon, of the 108th
Regiment of the (German) Line, was received from Champigny,
November 30th, 1870. A ball had passed through the left thigh;
another had passed through the pubis. On admission to the ambu-
lance he had retention of urine, and was exhausted from haemor-
rhage, and vomited freely bile and stercoraceous matter. The
bladder was emptied by the use of the catheter twice a day. His
wounds were covered with warm water applications and enveloped
in oil-silk. Constant vomiting of food and faecal matter continued
until death. Inflammation of the peritoneum was manifested by
great tenderness and distension of the abdomen. Great consti-
pation existed, and could not be wholly relieved by enemas.
<pb>
Chloral and opium were given to combat the pain, but without
effect. These conditions continued without much variation until
the fourth day,when he died. A post-mortem revealed the fact that
the first ball had passed near the trochanter major, and through the
gluteal muscles, having its exit through the middle and anterior
part of the thigh. The second ball had passed under the skin,
externally to the spine of the right pubis, thence obliquely
downward and backward into the gluteal region, opening, in its
course, the abdominal cavity over Poupart's ligament, about one
inch from the spine of the pubis. The abdominal cavity was
filled with serum, and the intestines glued together from the
extensive peritonitis above alluded to.
Case 147.—Private Joseph Coupe, a Mobile of Isle and
Vilaine, was wounded at Champigny, November 30th, 1870,
by a large fragment of shell. The projectile crushed his
left leg so badly as to leave it hanging by the posterior
muscles. He lay twenty-four hours on the field. December
1st, he was received at the ambulance, and was almost imme-
diately put under the influence of chloroform ; the amputation
was performed at the upper third of the leg, by a short anterior
and long posterior flap. He had lost blood so largely on the
field that he was nearly pulseless, and did not lose more than
three ounces of blood during the operation. The flaps were
brought together by adhesive plasters, and the stump dressed
with oakum, and covered with dry compresses and oil-silk.
Delirium intervened, and continued for five days; pulse 190.
December 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, he repeatedly tore off his dressings;
and on the 2nd, in the absence of the watcher, he left his bed
and fell heavily upon his stump, terribly bruising it. So great
was the shock caused by this injury, that it seemed as if the
patient would succumb to it, but, under the influence of proper
nourishment and stimulants, his general condition improved,
though the delirium continued. On the 5th a large slough
appeared on the upper and outer angle of the wound. This
extended gradually downward until the 9th, when it separated,
leaving a healthy granulating surface. The delirium passed off
on the 6th, leaving him greatly reduced in strength, without
appetite, and suffering from a severe pain in the stump, probably
<pb>
caused by the fall above spoken of. Profuse discharges from
the stump tended still further to reduce his strength. The local
pain was relieved by opium and chloral; the wound was stimu-
lated by diluted nitric acid; the appetite was restored by tonics
and stimulants; the limb was painted with iodine; suppuration
was favoured by warm water compresses alternately with
poultices enveloped in oil-silk; and the parts and dressings were
deodorized with dilute carbolic acid, as often as necessary. It
was soon found that in addition to the large slough of the soft
parts, the exposed end of the tibia had become carious. The pro-
fuse discharge caused by the inflammation following the injury,
the large amount of blood lost prior to the accident, the shock
from the fall, the severe pain following the accident, and the
fearful exertions during the five days of delirium, left but little
hope for his recovery. Notwithstanding, his cheerful, buoyant
nature—under vigorous stimulative and tonic treatment—aided
in his rapid improvement from the 9th, when the slough sepa-
rated, until the 15th, when, upon consultation, it was deemed
advisable to remove the necrosed tissue of the bone. December
15th, an exposed portion of the extremity of the tibia (If of an
inch) was sawn off. The operation was borne well, and the
patient appeared to be progressing favourably. The bone
granulated kindly, and the whole surface of the wound became
healthy. December 26th, the stump was uniting finely, but
there was still a small discharge of pus from the surface near the
tibia. December 31st, it became evident that the knee-joint was
involved. January 3rd, an abscess was opened below the knee,
and from this opening pus discharged daily in increased quan-
tities. The prostration occasioned by this suppuration prevented
all hope from farther operative interference. January 10th,
another abscess formed, and was opened, and a small portion of
the femur became visible. On the 14th this abscess had granu-
lated; but a large bed sore had in the meantime formed on the
patient's back. An india-rubber drainage-tube was passed into
the opening in the thigh, and maintained there. By means of
this the wound was frequently washed out with dilute nitric
acid. January 12th, diarrhoea. January 14th, was much
weakened, though rallying somewhat under free application of
<pb>
stimulants. On the morning of the 15th the stump looked per-
fectly healthy and was rapidly healing; while the seat of the
abscess above had granulated, and was discharging moderately.
January 16th, sinking fast; tongue clean, teeth white, pulse
feeble, no febrile symptoms, stump presents the same healthy
appearance—fine suppuration and granulation ; at 5 p.m. rallied
a little under repeated doses of brandy. On the 17th the stump
looked well. The patient died at 5 p.m. on the 18th. There
is no doubt that had he had strength to hold out a few more
days the tibia would have sloughed out from the joint; nor can
there be any doubt that death resulted from the continual drain
on his system, induced by the increased suppuration from the
violence of his fall, and the shock, and constitutional irritation
occasioned by it, together with the great prostration ensuing
from the quantity of blood lost during the twenty-four hours he
lay upon the field of battle.
Case 148.—Private Prosper Chretien, of the 120th Regi-
ment, was received from Bourget, December 21st, 1870. A
shell had fractured the pelvis and the hip joint. Several large
fragments of shell and of lead (nearly 30 ounces), with a mass of
cloth, were extracted from the wound, which was some eight
inches in diameter. Another fragment of shell had crushed the
opposite knee-joint. When admitted, he was in a dying condi-
tion. Died one and a-half hours after arrival.
Case 150.—Private Sylvain Johais, of the 120th Regiment of
the Line, was wounded the 21st of December, 1870, at Bourget.
A fragment of shell had entered the right arm at the external
border, of the biceps, at the junction of the middle and lower thirds,
and passed obliquely downward and backward between the triceps
and the humerus. The patient was much exhausted, and had a
feeble circulation, caused by haemorrhage, insufficient food, and
exposure to intense cold. On admission, warmth was applied to
the extremities; hot drinks we$e given, and stimulants were
freely used. Warm water dressings covered with oil-silk were
used up to the 26th, when poultices of linseed-meal were sub-
stituted. December 31st, the large orifices of the wounds began
to decrease, and healthy granulations in abundance had formed.
The wounds continued to heal, and the patient became conva-
<pb>
lescent, when on the 4th of January he complained of stiffness of
the muscles of the jaw, of pains in the glands of the neck, of diffi-
culty in digestion, and of colics. Chloral, of the strength of one
part to fifty of water and syrup, was given in doses of one table-
spoonful per hour. January 5th, spasmodic action, and rigidity
of the jaws, muscles of the mouth, and throat ensued. The
spasms lasted about a quarter of an hour, and were succeeded by
nausea and pains in the abdominal region. Doses of chloral
were continued alternately with opium cigarettes of two grains
each. January 6th, less rigidity of the muscles of the upper
part of the body, but increase in rigidity of those of the trunk
and lower members. Opium pills of one grain each were given
every two hours in addition to the chloral and cigarettes.
January 7th, retention of urine ensued, which was relieved with
the catheter. The doses of chloral and opium were then in-
creased. January 8th, increased rigidity and hardness of all the
muscles; had great, difficulty in swallowing. Muriate of mor-
phia, of the strength of one grain to six drops, was given in
doses of ten drops every three-quarters of an hour. Cigarettes
of the increased strength of four grains each, together with the
regular doses of chloral, and of opium pills, were also smoked
by the patient. Linseed-meal fomentations were applied to the
neck, chest, abdomen, and legs; treatment seemed to lessen the
permanent muscular rigidity. January 9th, several spasms
occurred during the day and night, and the jaws became firmly
closed. Liquid food and anodynes were given through the
space afforded by a missing tooth. January 11th, subcutaneous
injections of sulphate of morphia (one grain to twenty drops)
were administered every eight hours in addition to the doses of
laudanum, chloral, and opium, by cigarettes. This day the
patient was enabled to urinate freely and without assistance of
catheter. The jaws relaxed and his appetite returned. January
12th, spasmodic action again became very violent. Anodynes
were re-administered in increased doses. The spasms continuing,
anodynes were used at discretion, their frequency and strength
being diminished toward the end in proportion to the strength
of the patient and the severity of the spasms. Throughout the
whole period the patient was plied with as much of food and
<pb>
stimulants as could be taken. January 15th, spasms with in-
creased opisthotonos re-occurred. The entire body became stiff
and rigid; patient's respiration was laboured, he foamed at the
mouth and bit his tongue as one with epilepsy. Excessive debility
and profuse perspiration followed. The wounds still remained
healthy, and continued to heal; the mind and memory were at
all times clear and good; urination now was frequent and free;
simple injections kept the bowels open; perspiration was most
profuse from all the upper parts of the body, while fomentations
were applied to such parts as exhibited excessive hardness or
tension. This condition continued, with but slight variation, up
to the 29th of January. Then syphilitic eruptions appeared over
the entire body, for which iodide of potassa in five-gram doses
was given every four hours. Subcutaneous injections of iodide
of mercury (ten drops every two days) were commenced, and
continued to the 6th of February. The patient, we subse-
quently learned, had been under treatment in a military hospital
for nearly a year for syphilitic disease. January 31st, a trouble-
some cough supervened, with a secretion of tenacious mucus; had
difficulty in expectoration and swallowing. Diarrhoea and
vomiting now set in, followed by great weakness, which continued
until February 4th, when the muscles became so relaxed that
the patient was able to sit up for a short time, complaining,
however, of oppression of the chest, cough, and constant expec-
toration. From February 5th to the 9th his weakness gradually
increased, profuse perspiration ceased, the muscles and limbs
relaxed, and stimulants of any kind failed to produce re-action.
He coughed incessantly, and vomiting having recommenced,
accompanied by frequent evacuations, he became thoroughly
exhausted, and died on the 10th of February, at 3.30 a.m., re-
maining conscious to the last. The disease did not interfere
with the healing process, since, when death occurred, the wounds
had entirely healed.
Case 153.—Captain Emile Dassonville, commanding the 21st
Artillery, was wounded at Bourget, December 21st, 1870. A
large fragment of shell had struck the back just below the left
scapula and entered the pleural cavity. The soft parts of the
back were fearfully bruised. On admission he was exhausted,
<pb>
weak and nervous. Rapidly sinking, he died within forty-eight
hours after arrival.
Case 155.—Private Ernest Guilbert was wounded at Bourget,
December 21st, 1870. A splinter of shell, about a cubic inch in
size, had entered just above the left nipple, passed obliquely
upward across the chest, and had made its exit about three
inches vertically above the right nipple. It had thus caused a
jagged wound of some ten inches in length. In its course three
large openings were made in the skin, while the sternum had
been crushed and depressed so as to rest upon the thoracic
viscera. On admission to the ambulance the patient was suffer-
ing considerably from his wound, previous exposure and insuf-
ficient food, but had lost little blood. Three hours after
admission, when full re-action had taken place, haemorrhage
supervened so severely, that it was only arrested by plugs and
compresses of lint saturated in perchloride of iron, covered by
large compresses, and bandaging of the chest. On the fifth day
a piece of shell was found near the point of exit. On the sixth,
slight haemorrhage of the left side-occurred. Compression, tight
bandaging, and an astringent application again controlled the
bleeding until the 29th of December, when pus was fully
secreted. Subsequently to . this date the dressings consisted of
warm water applications with dilute nitric acid. January 1st,
the broken portion of the sternum showed evidence of necrosis.
January 2nd, it had a more honeycomb appearance, and was
rapidly dissolving by the secretions. January 3rd, diarrhoea set
in, which continued two days, when the patient died, worn out by
the great drain from a system much enfeebled by exposure and
want of food, and an inability to take it after admission. Diarrhoea
probably accelerated the fatal issue, though the exhaustion
produced by such a severe suppurating wound, and in such
close proximity to vital parts, was the more direct cause of
death.
Case 156.—Adjutant Ferdinand Barbier, 15th Battery, 7th
Regiment of Artillery, was wounded at Bourget, December 21st,
1870. He had received two wounds. A piece of shell, about
two inches long by one inch broad, had entered the middle of
the right gluteal muscle, crushing the neck of the femur and
<pb>
trochanter; it was extracted just over the right trochanter major.
A piece of shell had entered the opposite knee, crushing the
whole joint. Treatment consisted of palliatives only. Patient
died twenty-four hours after his arrival at the ambulance.
Case 162.—Private Edward Hedouin, 5th Battalion, 50th
Regiment of March of the Lower Seine, was wounded at
Bourget, December 21st, 1870. A ball had struck his head
under the right ear, near the mastoid process, fracturing the
skull but not entering the brain. On admission the patient was
in a state of semiconsciousness. This state continued to exist
with little or no variation until December 26th, five days after
arrival, when symptoms of inflammatory action having appeared,
bags of ice were applied to the head, while ice was also given
internally. December 27th, delirium set in accompanied by diar-
rhoea. For the former the ice treatment was continued; for the
latter mistura cretce was administered. Chloral was freely used
to arrest spasmodic action and to produce quietude. The
diarrhoea was checked, but the cerebral symptoms and spasms
continued unabated until January 11th, when patient died. A
post-mortem disclosed a fracture through the base of the skull
and the presence of meningitis, with the formation of pus within
the cranium. .
Case 164.—Private Rhodolphe Pierre Breillot, 2nd Company,
1st Regiment of the Scouts of the Seine, was received from
Bourget, December 21st, 1870. A ball had entered the skull
between the frontal and temporal bones, fracturing and de-
pressing the bone. The ball was extracted on the field. He
was unconscious on admission. This condition continued, with
more or less variation, until the 29th. During this period he ate
little. On the 29th, eight days after admission, inflammatory
action with great local heat, restlessness, and delirium ensued.
For these conditions bags of ice were applied to the head; ice
was also given internally. From this date to the day of his
death, a period of four days, he continued unconscious and
delirious. Towards the last his pulse became very quick and
hard, his respiration short and laboured; convulsions followed,
and continued until the 2nd of January, when he died.
Case 168.—2nd Lieutenant Jules Michel, of the Scouts of the
u u
<pb>
Seine, was wounded January 13th, 1871. A ball had entered
the left chest, about three inches from the sternum, fractured
the third rib, traversed the lung, and passing out through the
ninth rib, with fracture of same, was found lodged in the muscles
of the back about 2£ inches from the spinous process of the
vertebra. The patient was very weak on admission, from loss of
blood, exposure, deficient nourishment, &c. He continued to
sink, notwithstanding stimulants and nourishment were freely
given, until the 24th, ten days after admission, when he died.
Case 169.—Corporal John Charles Bruneteau, 8th Company,
90th Battalion, Paris National Guards, was wounded January 14th,
1871. He had sustained, from a fall on a large pointed picket,
a compound and comminuted fracture of the left fibula, just
below the articulation with the tibia, with great destruction of the
muscles of the anterior part of the leg—a badly lacerated wound.
He was in a low typhoidal state of health, and very feeble on
arrival, having for many days been deprived of a proper
quantity of food and fuel. His wound was dressed with lint and
alum, to arrest haemorrhage. At the end of six days a slight
amount of pus was discharged. The limb was then covered with
cold water applications and oil-silk, and properly supported.
At the end of ten days inflammation extended to the knee-joint,
where pus formed, and was removed from time to time by
Dieulafoy's apparatus. The pus from the wound was offensive,
and mixed with blood. From his entrance into the ambulance
the patient continued in a typhoid, soporific state. He took some
food and stimulants, but to no avail. He became weaker day by
day, and finally died January 31st, seventeen days after the injury.
Case 178. — Private Simon Goudrier, 1st Company, 211th
Battalion, 18th Regiment, National Guards, was wounded at
,Montretout, January 19th, 1871. A ball had entered the left
foot at the junction of the tarsus and the metatarsal bone of the
great toe, and, passing obliquely upwards and backwards through
the superior part of the arch of the tarsus, had its exit anterior to
the external malleolus, cutting in its course the anterior tibial
artery, but not opening the ankle-joint. The patient was much
exhausted from loss of blood and from intemperate habits.
Haemorrhage occurred at intervals for some days after arrival, but
<pb>
this was arrested by astringents and cold water applications. When
admitted he was greatly enfeebled from want of proper nourish-
ment and from inability to receive or digest food. This feeble
state continued until February 9th, when his appetite completely
failed. The wounds were enveloped in compresses covered with
oil-silk cloth. Subsequently linseed-meal poultices were added.
January 24th, suppuration commenced. January 28th, several
small spiculae were removed from the wound of exit. February
5th, an abscess formed near the external malleolus, and was opened.
There was a copious discharge of healthy pus. February 8th,
the suppuration from wounds and flow of pus and discharge from
the abscess were healthy and abundant. February 9th, brandy,
with eggs and milk-punch, were added to the other stimulants,
but without effect, the patient refusing food altogether. Death
ensued February 12th.
Case 184.—Private Henri Molin, of the 136th Regiment,
was wounded at Montretout, January 19th, 1871. A ball had
entered the left leg, on the inner side, about one inch below the
knee-joint, between the epiphysis and the shaft, and near the
posterior angle of the tibia, and passed obliquely backward
through the posterior face of the tibia, having its exit posteriorly
to the fibula. As it was doubtful whether or not a fissure had
been made in the joint, it was deemed to be a suitable case for
conservation. On arrival the patient was unable to eat, and was
therefore sustained as far as possible by stimulative and concen-
trated liquid food. Ice and other cold applications not sufficing
to reduce the inflammation, recourse was had to irrigation. This
treatment was continued to the 23rd, when, the inflammation
having in a measure subsided, and the patient having experienced
a feeling of discomfort therefrom, it was discontinued, and warm-
water dressings with oil-silk cloth substituted. From the first
the man did not rally, nor did he even respond to food and stimu-
lants; his strength gradually failed until the 27th, when he died.
A post-mortem examination revealed the fact that the bone
was fissured extensively into the joint, and for a distance
of almost three inches. The joint had also freely secreted
healthy pus.
Case 188.—Private Jean de Menitroux, 4th Regiment of
<pb>
Artillery, was wounded at Montretout, January 19th, 1871.
A ball had entered the left arm near the insertion of the
deltoid, and had passed through and made its exit at the
posterior face of the triceps, fracturing in its course the
humerus in the upper third below the head, but not involving
the joint. The patient was much exhausted from loss of blood
on the field. This condition was aggravated by a severe cough
and by a pulmonary disorder-, which disorder was probably occa-
sioned by long exposure anterior to the date of the injury. The
patient was also suffering from rheumatic pains and swelling in
both legs and the right arm and hand, to such a degree that the day
after arrival he could not move without assistance. The wounds
were enveloped with warm water dressings and covered with
oil-silk cloths. January 25th, suppuration began; a caoutchouc
drainage-tube was inserted, and the wounds were syringed with a
weak solution of carbolic acid. Immobility of the arm was obtained
by splints and bandages and compresses, which were removed and
cleaned daily. On the 7th of February the discharge of pus was free
and healthy; granulations appeared around the edges of the wounds.
There was no inflammation in the arm. The cough still con-
tinued, violently racking patient's whole frame, and causing suffer-
ing as well as exhaustion. February 10th, the appearance of the
arm and of the wounds was favourable; the appetite and spirits
of the patient had improved; the discharges were abundant and
healthy. At 6 o'clock p.m. of this day a violent fit of coughing
was the cause of a sudden haemorrhage, which lasted some ten
minutes before it was effectually arrested. The arrestation was
effected by compression. The loss of blood had been so con-
siderable that it was thought most advisable to ply the sufferer
with stimulants. At 2 a.m. of the night of February 11th, a
second haemorrhage, induced by the same cause, took place with
such violence that, prostrated by loss of blood, the patient died
in about fifteen minutes, and before the arrival of the surgeon.
A post-mortem showed that the pointed inferior end of the
fractured humerus had cut the tissues, and thereby caused the
haemorrhage. It was apparent, however, that death had been
caused by haemorrhage in a subject already much enfeebled by
previous disease.
a
<pb>
Case 189.—Private Louis Seppe, 3rd Company, 78th Batta-
lion, 16th Regiment, National Guard, was wounded January
19th, 1871. A ball entering the right foot at the centre of the
tibio-tarsal articulation, had passed obliquely backwards and
inwards, and out through the internal malleolus, injuring the
posterior tibial artery. A second ball entering the nates near
the os sedentarium, had passed obliquely down through the thigh
anterior to the femur, a distance of ten inches, before making
its exit. A third ball entering the right forearm two inches
below the external condyle of the humerus, had passed obliquely
downwards and backwards, and out on the inner side of the
middle of the forearm. The patient had just been discharged
from a hospital as convalescent from small-pox. He was
much exhausted from loss of blood, exposure and insufficient
food. The first wound was enlarged and all loose spiculse re-
moved, and covered with compresses saturated in cold water, to
arrest haemorrhage and inflammatory action; and subsequently
with ice to effect the same end. When inflammation had sub-
sided, the ankle was enveloped in warm water applications
covered with oil-silk. The leg and foot were placed in a wire
gutter well padded with oakum. From the first there was
disinclination to take food and wine. There was no general
re-action of the system. Though the wound of the ankle-joint
suppurated freely, neither of the upper wounds secreted pus.
The patient never fully rallied, though stimulated liberally, but
gradually sank, and died February 2nd.
Case 204.—Private Edward Baudette, of the 120th Regiment,
was wounded at Montretout, January 19th, 1871. A ball had
lodged in the frontal bone, about two inches above the right
eye; had crushed in the entire skull, and had also torn the dura
mater from its attachments. Several large fragments of both
the outer and inner tables were removed. A second ball had
passed between the thumb and index finger of the left hand.
On arrival the mental powers of the patient were apparently
unimpaired. Cold water compresses were the only dressings
for the first two days. January 21st, severe re-active inflamma-
tion having ensued, accompanied by delirium, bags of ice w'eref
substituted. January 24th, the delirium increased during' the1
<pb>
day; violent spasmodic action followed, and at 10 p.m. of this
day, and four days after the injury, death terminated his suf-
ferings.
Case 205.—Private Victor Auger, a Sharp-shooter of the 120th
Regiment, was wounded at Montretout, January 19th, 1871. A
ball entering the left shoulder about the middle of the external
surface of the deltoid muscle, had passed obliquely downward to
the right, and entered the chest, fracturing the fourth rib in its
passage; thence through the lung and out of the chest, fracturing
the tenth rib, speeding along in the soft parts under the skin to
the lumbar region, where it made its exit. On admission, the
circulation of the blood was so far arrested as to produce lividity
of the countenance. The patient expectorated blood and mucus
freely. Circulation was soon fully restored by the application of
hot water, and stimulating drinks. Difficulty of breathing,
severe cough, and expectoration of blood continued; delirium
and fever soon followed, and continued until death. On admis-
sion the patient was much exhausted from exposure and want of
food, and when compelled to take food, notwithstanding his
loathing for it, the stomach did not respond. He continued to
sink until the 25th, when he died. The post-mortem revealed
pleuritis, with effusion of blood and pus in the pleura.
Case 222.—Private Rene Delaunay, 1st Company, 1st Bat-
talion, 109th Regiment of the Line, was wounded at Montretout,
January 19 th, 1871. A ball had entered the external and supe-
rior part of the leg, and passed out on the internal side of the
calf, breaking the fibula in its passage. On arrival at the ambu-
lance, the patient was suffering from a cough and the effects of bad
food. The limb was much swollen, and the circulation below the
knee very feeble. A rubber drainage-tube was immediately passed
through the wounds to relieve effusion. On the day after admis-
sion less vitality was manifested in the limb, and on the following
day vitality had entirely ceased. This was probably due to ithe
destruction of the arteries in the passage of the ball, the leg being
more or less gangrened from the knee down. Immediate ampu-
tation was performed above the knee by a long anterior and a
short posterior flap, the patella being enucleated after it had been
raised and the flaps were united with sutures. The patient
<pb>
received the chloroform well, and lost no appreciable quantity of
blood. The stump was covered with oakum and a large com-
press, oil-silk covering the whole. The same dressing was
re-applied forty hours after. On the third day, in addition to the
other treatment, the thigh was bandaged from the groin down,
to give better support to the stump. On the fifth day healthy
pus was secreted in abundance. A lotion of nitric acid was used
to increase the action of the wound. No union was obtained by
first intention. On the twelfth day the whole wound was
covered with healthy granulations. The parts were carefully
drawn together with diachylon. The same treatment was
continued, and by the twentieth day after the operation the
wound was nearly closed. On the twenty-fifth day, when he
was considered entirely out of danger, he suffered from the
great cold occasioned by want of fuel, and was seized with
severe chills. Fever and loss of appetite ensued. From this
time he rapidly sank, dying on the twenty-seventh day after the
operation, evidently from general congestion produced by expo-
sure to cold. During the whole treatment the pus continued
healthy, and on the day of the patient's death the wound was
about closed.
Case 223.—Private Jules Alluard, 2nd Company, 2nd Bat-
talion, 136th Regiment of the Line, was wounded at Bougeval,
January 19th, 1871. On admission he was suffering from pneu-
monia. It was found that he had been wounded through the
lungs, diaphragm, liver, and intestines. The ball had entered on
the left side of the chest, three inches below the nipple, and
passing obliquely downward to the right, made its exit just above
the centre of the crest of the ilium, fracturing the ribs. Warm
water applications were spread over the whole abdomen and
chest. Stimulants were freely administered, and anodynes were
given to assuage pain. Little or no re-action took place. He
continued to sink from the combined effects of pneumonia and
the severe character of his injury, and died January 24th,
1871.
Cask 229.—Private Leon Combin, 4th Company, 3rd Bat-
talion, 109th Regiment of the Line, was admitted January 19th,
1871. A ball had entered the shoulder, passing through and
<pb>
fracturing the scapula, and lodging behind it. It was extracted
on the field. Combin had been also struck by splinters of shell on
the right side of the face. One of these penetrated the left eye
and lodged in the brain. On admission he was exhausted from
previous haemorrhage; on account of exposure, he was suffering
from cold and cough. His shoulder and chest were red and
swollen; breathing laboured, and pulse quick. Warm water
applications constituted the dressings. He daily grew feebler,
though plied with stimulants. Ice was applied to the head, and
given internally. He gradually sank, and died unconscious,
January 27th.
Case 240.— Private Adolphe Warocquier, 3rd Company,
78th Battalion, National Guard, was wounded January 19th,
1871, to wit: a fracture of the left ankle-joint—a ball had en-
tered at the junction of the tarsal and metatarsal bones, passed
obliquely through the anterior face of the tarsus, cutting in its
course the anterior tibial artery; a seton of the thigh—a ball
had entered the middle of the thigh, passing obliquely upwards
posteriorly to the femoral artery; a slight shell wound in the
right nostril at the aperture. The general condition of the
patient was unpromising. He was very delicate, of a highly
nervous temperament, anaemic, emaciated, and had much irrita-
tive fever. The treatment was limited to warm-water dressings.
The joint was very sensitive when handled. There was much
pain, which was greatly increased on moving the limb. The
limb was maintained in an easy position, and attention directed
to improve the general condition of the patient by a nourishing
diet and stimulants, which he refused. Notwithstanding these
unfavourable circumstances, the case progressed favourably until
January 30th, when secondary haemorrhage supervened, from
ulceration of the anterior tibial artery. The usual local remedies
were applied to guard against its return. February 1st, there
was again profuse haemorrhage. From this time onwards he
steadily lost ground. He became much emaciated. Daily his
powers of resistance failed. From the 5th of February his
wounds presented no active appearance. His strength had been
so exhausted by loss of blood and his previous condition, that
recuperation was impossible. The febrile symptoms increased,
<pb>
accompanied by nausea; on the night of the 7th there was
delirium. Death took place on the morning of the 8th.
Special Points.
IT is a noticeable fact, that up to the 1st of December,
about the time the battle of Champigny was fought, the
wounded suffered little, if any, from surgical diseases.
Up to that date there was nothing notable in the condition of
any of the wounded that would lead to the belief that causes
were at work which would in any wise deteriorate the blood, and
thereby jeopardize our surgical results.
Notwithstanding this, the wounded from that battle presented
from the very first an appearance unlike that with which we had
been previously familiar. The wounds were mainly of a very
grave character, and many proved fatal. Besides this, the
greater number of the men were suffering, more or less, from
the effects of insufficient and improper food; from vitiated air in
close and ill-ventilated sleeping apartments; from insufficient
cooking facilities for those who had always been accustomed to
the best; from camp accumulations of filth; from wet, exposure,
and cold: in short, the whole course of their lives had been
suddenly and violently changed, either from proper camp con-
veniences to such as their systems had not yet become accus-
tomed to, or from civil life, where they had enjoyed, in a gastro-
nomic, sanitary, and hygienic point of view, all that science
demands.
And to these causes of disease should be added the fact, that
enclosed within a cordon of five hundred thousand soldiers
was a city of nearly two millions of people suffering from the
causes above enumerated, and the additional fact, that this city
had become one vast hospital for the reception of the sick and
wounded, not only from within, but from the great army
without.
The whole story would not be told were I to neglect to state
<pb>
that, outside of the cordon of soldiers, there still existed the
enemy's numerous hordes, with such surroundings as an army
only can create, poisoning the air from whatsoever point of the
compass it might come to us; mingling also with the already
excessive accumulation of starving animal, faecal, and other
offensive and deleterious exhalations of the thousands of sick
and wounded, who were already suffering from blood-poison,
excreta which fouled even the beautiful stream that winds
through the city, and which, in rendering putrescent even the
sources of our water supply, became a potential source of poison.
Thus by the presence of two such armies as the world has
rarely seen before, together with the local city causes, including
insufficient and improper food, overcrowding of apartments,
insufficient clothing, and insufficient fuel, during one of the
most inclement winters known in Paris, is it surprising that
buildings, clothing, and bedding became foul, and pestilence
should stalk abroad in the shape of blood-poison, so that every
individual, whatever his condition in life or facilities for obtain-
ing food, felt the evil influences of the extreme times? A
moderate cold became typhoid fever, or a low species of bron-
chitis, pneumonia, pleurisy, peritonitis, or some other inflammatory
disease of a typhoid form; indicating clearly that every system
had been insensibly and insidiously invaded by an unseen foe.
There is now no difference of opinion among intelligent
students of medicine as to the fact of there being a condition
of the system under which can be grouped a large number of
diseases treated of as distinctive, but which, in fact, are due
to some uniform, abnormal state of the circulating medium,
although the condition may vary in intensity according to cir-
cumstances. From this condition comes erysipelas—whether of
the skin, internal organs, tissues, membranes or veins—or low
forms of cellular inflammation, low types of fever, traumatic,
spreading, or other forms of gangrene, and a multiplicity of
affections described and known as closely allied to, if not the
sequels of, the so-called pus-poisoning. There can be little
doubt that this cause, whatever its distinctive character may be,
is in the blood; and that it may remain dormant an indefinite
period, or until eliminated, unless some great, exciting cause,
<pb>
such as severe cold, insufficient and improper food, serious in-
juries, wounds, or surgical operations, arouse it into activity.
It is not my intention here to discuss the manner and mode of
the introduction of this poison into the system, the particular
form in which it exists prior and subsequent to its introduction,
or whether it is animal, vegetable, gaseous, or a simple change in
the constituents of the blood; but I shall rather endeavour to
present a correct summary of the conditions which have existed
among those treated at the American ambulance, and the conclu-
sions which I have drawn from them.
1. The records show one case only of erysipelas, and this pre-
sented itself in a patient suffering from a slight wound in the
scalp, in whom, the third day after his arrival, the disease was at
its height; on the sixth the patient was well.
2. There have been no fevers of a typhoid, or of any other
type, except as are detailed in the Report.
3. There has occurred one case of traumatic gangrene only,
and this was developed within forty-eight hours after the patient's
admission. The details of this case are given on the following
page.
4. There have been no well-marked cases of pus-poisoning; but
in order that the public may rest fully satisfied on this point, I
have given a detailed history of every death.
5. During the last part of December, and during January and
February, there was a want of recuperative power in nearly all
the wounded who were received; and this was most perceptible
among the more severely wounded, and those having compound
comminuted fractures. By a careless observer, this peculiar
condition of the system, with its sequels—imperfect recuperative
action followed by more or less bony necrosis—might be con-
founded with the condition commonly known as pus-poisoning.
But a more careful analysis of the whole report will show that, if
any such poison were present, it existed in the patient's system
prior to his admission into the ambulance, and was not due to
any causes that lurked therein.
Viewing the question from any point, there were but four
deaths as to the causes of which there could be any discussion.
In my mind there is no doubt that those, together with several
<pb>
others, were due to the extreme cold—at a time when we were
unable to procure fuel and proper food—acting upon systems
already impaired by causes above enumerated.
Before proceeding further, I deem it proper, that you may
fully appreciate what follows, to give a synopsis of the only ,
case of the four above alluded to, which is really worthy of an
especial consideration.
. Case 106.—Was treated in barrack No. 5, which, together with
its furniture, bedding, and clothing, was entirely new, and into
which no sick or wounded had before been admitted. The patient
came into the building in a typhoid state, suffering from a gunshot
fracture of the radius and ulna. Great infiltration of the parts
ensued; forty-eight hours after arrival traumatic gangrene of
the cellular tissues commenced in the forearm. Free incisions,
warm applications, disinfectants and dilute nitric acid, gave only
temporary relief, and did not prevent the extension of the
disease or the continuation of the unfavourable symptoms. Ampu-
tation was performed through the superior third of the humerus,
where the parts were entirely free from disease. The cut surface
soon granulated finely, and secreted an abundance of healthy
pus. Yet the stump soon after assumed an unhealthy appear-
ance, became hard and inflamed, and presented a dusky hue,
similar to that of the forearm prior to amputation. This con-
dition subsequently extended to the adjacent soft tissues of the
chest, and continued to extend to the moment of his death.
If this disease had declared itself at a much later period after
admission, and if the building had been used prior to his
entrance, and had not been entirely new, as it was, or if any
local cause had existed to which he was immediately exposed,
one might be induced to believe that it was a case of blood-
poisoning, superinduced by the influences surrounding him. But
as the case now stands, there can be no doubt that his disease
was contracted before his entrance into the ambulance; and that
the wound was only an exciting cause. In confirmation of this
view, Mr. Erichsen, in his work on surgery,1 states that:—" The
1 "The Science and Art of Surgery," by John Erichsen, vol. i. p. 123;
London, 1869.
<pb>
constitutional condition of the patient is undoubtedly the main
cause of the supervention of spreading traumatic gangrene.
However severe an injury may be, and however certainly it
may kill those tissues or that part of a limb which are directly
and immediately exposed to the operation of the external violence,
the rapidly spreading form of the disease will not supervene
unless the constitution be in an unsound state; and this remark
applies necessarily with especial force to its occurrence after
the slighter forms of injury. The supervention of spreading
traumatic gangrene will occur in circumstances similar to those
which dispose to pyaemia, erysipelas, or sloughing phagedaena;
and, in fact, to the low and diffuse inflammations generally. They
consist of imperfect and faulty hygienic conditions, and an impure
state of the blood, arising either from long-continued exposure
antecedent to the injury, to such conditions, or to chronic disease
of the eliminatory organs, more particularly of the kidneys. De-
fective depuration of the blood, consequent on chronic kidney-
disease, is a most fertile cause of this as of the other forms of
gangrene. Indeed, I believe that the true spreading or trau-
matic gangrene cannot occur unless the blood is, previously to the
receipt of the injury, in a depraved and disordered state, the result
of the conditions, singly or combined, above mentioned. Hospital
miasmata, and exposure to faulty hygienic conditions after the receipt
of the injury, do not appear to me to exercise so marked an influence
on the occurrence of this form of gangrene as of the low inflammatory
diseases of the erysipelatous type. In fact, the patient is rarely, if
ever, exposed to these influences sufficiently long after the occur-
rence of the injury for them to have much effect on his constitu-
tional condition, had that been in a sound state previously.
Spreading traumatic gangrene occurs only in recent wounds, and
usually manifests itself within the first three days after their
occurrence, while they are still in their first stage, and before
suppurative inflammation has set in. . . . I cannot, therefore,
but look upon this formidable disease as a truly constitutional affec-
tion, depending more upon the state of the patient's blood at the
time of the reception of the injury than upon the severity of that
injury or upon the circumstances to which he has been exposed
immediately after the receipt of it."
<pb>
We now come to the question, whether any one treated in the
ambulance had any of the sequels of blood or pus-poisoning;
and if so, from what source it arose.
Up to December, as I have before stated, all the wounded re-
mained healthy. Subsequently, the tents were not more crowded,
and the same scrupulous observation of all the hygienic laws
was continued with regard to the patients, tents, beds, cloth-
ing, &c.; but, as in the case of traumatic gangrene, before com-
mented on, other cases of compound fracture resulted unsatis-
factorily.
Still there was no observable specific disease; but the patients'
stomachs, at the time of admission, failed to respond to food and
stimulants, or were unable to digest what was taken: in short,
there was no recuperative power in the system. Necrosis of the
fractured shaft or joint and a low form of suppurative inflamma-
tion would ensue. The discharges became offensive, and the
patient would generally sink—eating more or less to the last—
but not relapsing into a typhoid condition, and except when ex-
posed to severe cold, as occasionally happened when fuel failed,
and the fires were extinguished for many hours at a time, never
suffering from chills or fever.
Whence came this change? The cause was evidently not
from conditions special to the ambulance, but from the morbid
condition existing in the system on arrival; as in the above-men-
tioned case of traumatic gangrene, which was nothing more than
the representative of a large family of conditions each having a
specific name, depending upon the part or tissue involved, but
all depending upon a depraved state of the circulating medium
commonly denominated blood-poisoning.
When the blood is thus poisoned, disease is far more prevalent.
In proof of this I may instance the enormous increase of mor-
tality among those not wounded who sickened in and around
Paris from pneumonia, bronchitis, pleurisy, and typhoid, after
the 1st of December, 1870. In fact, all diseases had assumed a
low typhoid grade, few recovering from a severe attack of any of
the graver disorders. If disease, in those who were unmaimed,
proved so fatal in constitutions impaired by blood loaded with
effete material, should we not expect that the mortality among
<pb>
the severely wounded would be materially increased, particularly
when suffering from the want of proper food and fuel?
There were those among our wounded, however, who were
more fortunate, notwithstanding the severity of their wounds;
namely, Zouaves and soldiers of the line. For example, Case
134, a compound and comminuted fracture of the thigh, received
from the battle-field of Champigny, November 30th, 1870, re-
covered without an unfavourable symptom, and is possessed of a
perfect limb with only one and one-fourth of an inch shortening.
Case 166, in which the head of the humerus was crushed to
atoms, and the soft parts severely lacerated and burned by an
accidental shot from patient's own gun, recovered also. Other
cases occurred with similar histories and results. The good re-
sults here obtained were due conjointly to good constitutions and
to their having been quartered in the country, where they were
enabled to obtain a greater variety and a larger supply of food,
and where they were not exposed in the same degree to the ob-
noxious influences previously mentioned.
If any further arguments were needed to prove the position I
have taken, namely, that the disease from which our patients
suffered existed in the system, and only required a sufficient
development, or a grave injury, to render what was once a
passive condition an active disease, I would again refer to Mr.
Erichsen's work, in which this matter is summed up tersely and
to the point. In speaking of the necessary preparation of patients
for an operation, that writer says:1—"Closely allied to pyaemia,
frequently co-existing with it, having the same predisposing
causes, and associated with febrile disturbance of an asthenic
type, are the various low and diffuse inflammations, whether
assuming the form of erysipelas, of phlebitis, or of inflammation
of the absorbents, which are the dread of surgeons and the
scourge of hospitals. It is to pyaemia, and to these various
allied erysipelatous and low inflammations, with their attendant
asthenic constitutional disturbance, that at least three-fourths of
the deaths after operations are due. It is in the production of
these diseases that an impure blood, loaded with effete materials
Op. cit. vol, i. p. 8.
<pb>
(JG6
ON THE SURGICAL HISTORY
retained through habitual disregard of the ordinary rules of
health, or through defective elimination by the kidneys and skin,
acts as a potent predisposing cause, requiring but some injury or
wound to call into activity a most dangerous amount of local
inflammation and of constitutional disturbance. In these circum-
stances, it is not the extent or size of the wound that determines
the dangerous results. The mere fact of a breach of surface,
however trivial, is sufficient to excite these morbid processes, the
materials for which have been previously stored up in the system.
In such conditions of the system, the amputation of a toe may be
as fatal as that of the thigh, or the removal of a small scalp-
atheroma as the ablation of the breast; the only additional
danger essentially connected with the greater operations being
the increased risk from shock and haemorrhage."
This "low and diffuse inflammation" of the tissues surround-
ing compound fractures was exactly what was to be found at our
ambulance during the months of December, January, and
February. It was evident that its presence, which manifested
itself immediately after admission, was due to the causes men-
tioned in the above quotation, namely, to blood loaded with
effete material and retained therein, and requiring but some in-
jury or wound to call into activity a most dangerous amount of
local inflammation; and in case death were to result under such
circumstances, the verdict would be death from pyaemia; and the
chances are that the hospital, or the place where such persons
were treated, would be considered the unfortunate executioner.
Whereas Mr. Erichsen, and all other good authorities, advise de-
ferring any surgical operation during an epidemic of erysipelas,
low forms of diffuse inflammation, low forms of fever, or where
any condition exists in the atmosphere which has a tendency to
foul or deteriorate the blood. In these circumstances, as Mr.
Erichsen states, "the amputation of a toe may be as fatal as that
of the thigh." If that is true under the circumstances of which
he speaks, I assume that it would be so in the case under considera-
tion; for in addition to the exciting cause spoken of, we have to
superadd the fact that after arrival these men continued to suffer
more or less from insufficient and improper food and from insuffi-
cient and improper fuel, the obtainable fuel not being adapted to
<pb>
the furnaces. The manufactured coal emitted large volumes of
sulphureous gases; at one time fuel gave out for the space of
forty-eight hours; and at other times, during the most incle-
ment part of the winter, we were compelled to drag along
with a temperature so reduced as to produce great suffering.
Several deaths are directly traceable to the want of fuel.
Several were due, apparently, to exhaustion from cold during
the night preceding and the day of the battle of Bourget, fought
December 21st, 1870. Others, during the latter part of the
siege, had a like history, followed by the same melancholy
result.
 
The Medical and Surgical Staff.
CANNOT, with justice to others, and with conscientious
satisfaction to myself, close this Report without paying
a tribute to the faithfulness, zeal, and intelligence of
those who were so intimately associated with me, during the
siege of Paris, in a humane work.
It affords me unwonted pleasure to state that my associate,
William E. Johnston, M.D., has rendered invaluable services to
the sick who, from the latter part of December to the middle of
February, were in constant need of the care which he, in the
most skilful and generous manner, bestowed upon them. I
would refer you to his report, which will be read with much
interest. By a reference to the table on page 687, it will be seen
that all such cases as were not purely of a surgical character
were treated by him. You will also observe that a small pro-
portion of the medical cases had been wounded, but had either
been discharged or had been sent to the convalescent hospital,
where their disease was brought on by the causes previously
enumerated as incident to the siege.
The gentlemen who have acted as my assistants have rendered
valuable services, and were assiduous in their care and attention
<pb>
to the wounded. They assisted at the operations and dressings,
and were charged with the especial superintendence of the
wounded, each one being held responsible for the care of the
patients and the cleanliness of the ward under his supervision.
The following named gentlemen were received as assistants
in the order in which they here appear:—
William J. Brewer, V. E. Du Bouchet,
Emile Brewer, Frank M. O'Connell,
J. B. B. Cormack, Joseph K. Riggs,
Lewis Wingfield, Louis J. Swinburne.
Gilead Peet,
Of the above-named gentlemen only three were regular stu-
dents of medicine, and at the time pursuing their studies. Two
had paid especial attention to chemistry and pharmacy, and per-
formed the duties appertaining thereto. Owing to sickness and
other causes, there were never more than six on active duty.
In conclusion, and in taking leave of you, I desire to express
to you and to the Committee my sincere regret at parting, and
to thank you for the many acts of kindness manifested to me
a stranger in a strange land, and for the unbounded confidence
reposed in me in the management of the surgical department of
an institution of such importance in a national-representative
point of view—an institution expressing the sanitary, hygienic,
and surgical principles involved in the treatment of gunshot in-
juries as practised in the United States, and within which those
principles were first to be put into operation in a foreign but
friendly country.
In consideration of this expression of confidence, I am only too
happy to know that the result of my labour is such as to meet
with your approval. It is the only reward that I have sought.
While my connection with you and the American ambulance
extends through an eventful period of over six months, I am
pleased to state that the first difference of opinion, or unpleasant-
ness in our intercourse, has yet to arise. In fact, I am happy to
say that it has been the pleasantest six months of labour I have
ever been called upon to perform, notwithstanding the fearful
suffering we have witnessed among a proud but unfortunate people,
<pb>
struggling to maintain the honour of their arms and the integrity
of their territory.
I say pleasant, because conscious of the good we were all
striving to do in a humanitarian work, we still wished to remind
our ancient friends and allies that we had not forgotten and
would not ignore the relief extended to us during our struggle for
independence—that the great and good work of La Fayette and
his confreres was still fresh in the memory of all true Americans.
Hoping that you will convey to this warm-hearted and apprecia-
tive nation, with whom I am unable to confer in their own
tongue, my fullest expressions of gratitude for their continued
marks of approbation, esteem, and confidence—that if you are
again called upon to act in any official capacity, you may be en-
abled to perform the duty as faithfully, as conscientiously, and as
well as you have this, and that our relations may continue to be
as pleasant in the future as they have been in the past,
I remain,
Very respectfully yours,
John Swinburne.

OF THE AMERICAN
AMBULANCE.
A REPORT BY WILLIAM E. JOHNSTON, M.D.
<pb>
International Sanitary Committee.
Sir;
T is the first time in the history of sieges that
medical men have had an opportunity of observ-
ing the influence on health of so large an agglo-
meration of human beings as that now present at
Paris.
The ordinary sanitary condition of the city has been so much
improved by the efforts of the last twenty years, that compara-
tive safety was felt against the attacks of any of the usual forms
of pestiferous disease. But no calculations had been made on a
sudden addition to the population of nearly 300,000 soldiers and
poor people from the outside, with their old furniture, their
cattle and their swine. Much less had they taken into consi-
deration the aggravating circumstance of the influence on the
atmosphere of a large number of sick and wounded soldiers, of
the want of food and fuel, and the excessive and prolonged cold
weather.
It was not without the most serious apprehension, therefore,
that we watched the fluctuations of the mortality bill during the
progress of the siege, and the concordance in the variations of
the public health with the condition of our ambulance tents. It
was the first time this system of hospital had been tried in France
on a large scale, and the first time it had ever been tried in a
besieged city of such a size.
Y Y
<pb>
We not only watched with deep interest the effects of these
various pernicious influences on our patients, but we were natu-
rally anxious to seize upon some testimony bearing upon the
difficult question of the comparative healthfulness of the climates
of the two hemispheres, and of the power of resistance and of
recuperation of the two races.
Much light was thrown, we think, upon some of these points
by the results obtained.
Thus, it may be said that, from the moment of installation in
the month of September till the middle of the month of Decem-
ber, that is to say, while it was still possible to obtain regular
supplies of food and fuel, and while the men who came in were
not too much prostrated by the privations of the siege, there was
an almost complete exemption from disease in the 157 wounded
men received up to that time. A few cases of ephemeral fever
from gastric derangements; a few cases of diarrhoea of a mild
type; and one case of light variola—in fine, hardly more dis-
turbance of the system than would have been observed in the
same number of men in active duty in the field; the gravity of
the wounds, moreover, apparently bearing no relation to the
nature or the force of the malady. These were the only mani-
festations of disease we were called on to observe.
While bronchitis, pneumonia, typhoid fever and small-pox
were on the increase in the barracks, and among the civil
population; while the bill of mortality in the city was rising from
981 a week to the enormous figure of 4,671—a figure which
would have carried off one-eighth of the entire population
in a year, and which killed from six to eight times more people
than the war—the inmates of our tents, notwithstanding their
apparently crowded state, continued to enjoy a perfect immu-
nity from any grave form of disease.
Up to this point in the history of the ambulance, that is to
say, till about the middle of December, there had been no great
difficulty in obtaining a sufficiency of food and fuel; and the
results, as will be seen by this and the surgeon's report, were in
the highest degree satisfactory. But after this period several
seriously wounded men died whose symptoms were clearly
traceable to the effects of cold or a want of proper nourishment;
<pb>
and toward the middle of January it was evident that a certain
typhoid condition had invaded the tents, and, in an insidious
way, was furnishing a slight increase to our mortality ratio.
Thus, in the second fortnight of January, a man with a
contused wound of no special gravity died after a week's illness
from typhoid symptoms of a well-marked form.
Another man with a flesh wound of the shoulder was attacked
with a pleuro-pneumonia in an insidious way, and died at the
end of four days. He had a slight cough, with a light mucous
crepitation for a few days, without fever, and was not considered
in any danger, when all his symptoms suddenly grew worse, both
lungs filled up rapidly, the expectoration changed to orange
colour, there was tympanitis, sordes in the mouth, and delirium.
He was treated with an expectorant mixture, brandy, blisters,
and abundant nourishment.
Another man attacked about the same time, and in the same
way, with pleuro-pneumonia, and who had also a flesh wound of
the chest, died even more rapidly than the preceding one. His
disease had also lain latent for several days.
Eight other cases of pneumonia and two of bronchitis were
treated in the period between the middle of January and the
middle of February, three only of which were wounded men.
All of these cases recovered but one—a man who was brought
in from without the walls in a hopeless condition with bronchitis.
The treatment of these cases consisted generally in Todd's
brandy mixture, blisters, poultices, nourishing diet, and some-
times, when the cough was too violent, an expectorant mix-
ture.
A very young man who came in with a flesh wound of the
thigh had several epileptic fits after his entrance, and was finally
seized with scarlet fever, although it was the only example of
this disease in the ambulance, and died.
Another man with a contused wound of the back was seized
five days after his entry with confluent small-pox, and got well.
He was isolated at once, but communicated the disease in a
lighter form to the aid-surgeon charged with his nursing.
The other attacks of disease in the ambulance, independent
of purely surgical conditions, were of the most ordinary and
<pb>
accidental kind, without special bearing upon miasmatic or atmo-
spheric influences.
The foregoing is in brief the medical history of the ambulance;
and we think we are authorized in drawing from it the following
conclusions:—
1. That so long as the exterior conditions were normal, that is
to say, for a period of three months, the sanitary condition of the
ambulance was most remarkable.
2. That, after this period, several deaths and several attacks of
disease were directly traceable to the influence of cold and the
want of food, at a moment when the supplies of food and fuel
were irregular and insufficient.
3. That the condition of the men on entering was, after a
certain period, generally bad, from insufficient nourishment and
the fatigues of the siege.
4. That the soldiers of the line, who most frequently occupied
the outposts and had fresh vegetables to eat, resisted the fatal
effects of wounds better than those fed on a less healthful diet.
5. That the scorbutic or typhoid condition, which manifested
itself in the ambulance towards the close, depended on the condi-
tion of the men on entering, and on the bad medical constitution
of the city at the time.
6. That notwithstanding these pernicious exterior influences,
which operated equally on all, the number of deaths in this
ambulance, as the statistics will show, did not reach the ratio of
mortality, depending upon the same influences, elsewhere.
7. That as regards the comparative healthfulness of the two
climates and the two races, the experiment was too limited to
admit of a positive indication; but that to the medical men who
had been in the habit of treating the same accidents in the
Western hemisphere, the general physiognomy of the ambulance
was most striking, and left the conviction that, whatever the
cause or causes, the power of resistance and of recuperation was
inferior to that which they had been in the habit of observing.
